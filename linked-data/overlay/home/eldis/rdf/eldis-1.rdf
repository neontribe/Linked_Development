    <dcterms:title>Impact of out-of-pocket expenditures on families and barriers to use of maternal and child health services in Cambodia: evidence from the Cambodia socio-economic survey 2007</dcterms:title>

    <dcterms:abstract>Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific region, yet it has made substantial progress in improving child health outcomes and health service coverage. However, maternal mortality and neonatal mortality rates remain among the highest in Asia and the Pacific. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilising a special socio-economic survey, the paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;heavy reliance on out-of-pocket spending for healthcare is burdensome to Cambodian families, and they spend a greater share of their overall budget on medical care than households in almost any other Asian country&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the incidence of catastrophic medical expenditures in Cambodia is very high by regional standards, and many families are impoverished by the medical treatment of sick children &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;large inequalities exist in healthcare use by adults and children in Cambodia; poor and rural Cambodians make less use of both public and private sector providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document underlines that cost is the major factor discouraging parents from taking their sick children for care, or from using public sector providers. Thus, reducing the financial costs of healthcare borne by poor families is critical to improve access to maternal and child health services in Cambodia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the author invites Cambodia to substantially increase public investment to reduce financial barriers to accessing healthcare facilities, and further reduce the costs of obtaining treatment at public facilities, in particular. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Background: An understanding of epidemiological trend in hospital admissions, including diseases and death pattern, is critical for health care planning, appropriate resource allocation &amp; improving existing services facilities. Objectives: To evaluate the disease and death pattern of children admitted in the department of Child Health, Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Chittagong. Methods: This was a retrospective study. The case records of all patients admitted in the department from Jan 1, 2008 to Dec 31, 2010 were analyzed. Total 38,692 children were admitted during this study period; among them total 1897(4.9%) patient died. Infant and under five age groups constitute 45.2% and 75.9% respectively, total admission whereas deaths from the same groups were 43.7% &amp; 79.3% respectively. Bronchopneumonia (22%), acute watery diarrhea (15%),hereditary hemolytic anemia (12%), and bronchiolitis (10%), topped the first four positions in each of the three years of admission. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>CCT programmes have had proven success in improving education and health outcomes, but that success depends on the quality and adequacy of implementation. Effective implementation must take into account each country’s context and the opportunities - and limits - of its own institutional capacity. It must consider technical, operational and socio-political factors, as all of these can influence the programme’s effectiveness. This brief presents four main steps in implementing a successful CCT programme, and in each, draws on the Latin American experience to highlight key issues policymakers should consider when creating an implementation strategy in other contexts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper uses a critical analysis of citizen voice and accountability (CV&amp;A) cases to examine how CV&amp;A happens in different governance contexts. According to author Fletcher Tembo, CV&amp;A project interventions produce and reproduce diverse outcomes that are not amenable to linear models of theories of change. The analytical framework used in this paper draws on the tools of outcome mapping (OM) and political economy analysis (PEA). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The direction and pace of development in ICT have led practically all world economies to recognize the improvement of ICT in catalyzing economic activity, in efficient governance, empowerment of society and bringing about major socio-economic transformations in societies. Developing countries like India, have, therefore, made significant investments in these technologies and integrated the same with the development programmes to gainfully realize the fruits of such developments to their society. However, it is realized that this development has created a divide between the ‘have’ and the ‘have-nots’ in the form of a gap between the ‘technology empowered’ and the ‘technology excluded’ communities. This paper highlights the digital divide scenario in India, various ICT initiatives undertaken and the major challenges and key solutions in bridging the digital divide in the Indian context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document represents the Vision for Ghana in the information age. It is based on the Policy Framework Document: “An Integrated ICTled
Socio-economic Development Policy and Plan Development Framework for Ghana”. The development of this policy framework document was based on a nation-wide consultative process involving all key stakeholders in the public sector, private sector and civil society. It fully takes into account the aspirations and the provisions of key socio-economic development framework documents including: the Vision 2020 –The First Steps; the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and Social Development of Ghana. It sets out the road map for the development of Ghana’s information society and economy and provides a basis for facilitating the socio-economic development of the country in the emerging information, knowledge and technological age to be dominated by information and knowledge-based economies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>India is known around the world for the success of its export-oriented ICT services industry, but this paper asks whether ICTs have been valuable in providing broader development benefits to all Indian citizens. Secondary data from academic articles with a focus on India are used to analyse the contribution of ICTs towards the achievement of specific development goals. The analysis shows that many ICT-based initiatives have taken place over the last decade and some positive effects have resulted. However, the beneficiaries are almost always not the poorest or most disadvantaged groups, it is hard to scale up initiatives to have effects throughout India, and the need for attitudinal and institutional change remains a fundamental problem. It is argued that ICTs should not be seen as ‘silver bullets’ for development but neither are they irrelevant. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report was commissioned under the Climate Risk Management Technical Assistance Support Project (CRM TASP), a joint initiative of the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery and the Bureau for Development Policy of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Designed to support developing countries in managing the changing nature of climate risk, CRM TASP was implemented in Kenya by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report examines Kenya&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability to climate risks given the country's current progress toward meeting its defined development goals, looking particularly at its exposure to climate risks historically. It analyses how these risks might change in the future given available climate change projections; the degree to which key sectors of the Kenyan economy and particular groups are vulnerable to existing and future climate risks; and the country&amp;rsquo;s current capacity to address climate risks given its policy framework, institutional arrangements, information availability, ongoing projects and capacity needs. General recommendations to strengthen response capacity include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improve understanding of projected changes in climatic conditions, particularly rainfall patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Enhance knowledge and capacity to manage climate risks at the sub-national level, establishing appropriate horizontal and vertical coordinating bodies, and putting in place the technical, financial and human resources needed to support climate risk prevention, response and recovery. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Strengthen communication between climate scientists and policymakers to better facilitate the ongoing evolution of knowledge in this area, and ensure that decisions consider potential climate risks. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Greater attention must be directed toward understanding how climate risks differ between men and women, and incorporate this knowledge into planning and programming. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The collection of relevant socioeconomic, environmental and topographic data should be harmonised and centralised. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Continue to ensure that climate risks are integrated into relevant policies and programmes. Examples of current and future initiatives into which climate risk considerations could be integrated include the Water Catchment Management Initiative, the water sector investment plan (WSIP) and the National Spatial Plan.&lt;/li&gt;

It articulates the importance for understanding and taking into account citizens’ needs and priorities in the application of e-governance. While the existing literature has examined e-governance mostly in isolation, this paper argues that it needs to be considered in tandem with citizen engagement through an analysis of the relationship between citizens and the state institutions. We define citizen engagement as a process of participation in state affairs that goes beyond being able to voice an opinion, but also to participate in decision-making processes. Active engagement means being able to seek greater accountability and information through increased discussion and consultation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report, the second of three components of an IDRC RSP, draws upon an evaluation of eleven IDRC supported e-health (health and ICT) initiatives in Asia, with additional perspective from the authors experience and additional activities in other countries. Based upon the findings, a conceptual framework and methodology for a regional thematic research network - PANACeA (PAN Asian Collaborative for evidence-based e-health Adoption and Application) - is presented. This framework emphasizes methodologies to assess benefits and outcomes of e-health projects to IDRC and the region, and reflects regional variation in research capacity and development needs vis-à-vis e-health programs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Recent reports from developing countries show that the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of typhoid have significantly altered often leading to missed diagnosis. The incidence of complications is also reported to be variable. The consequence of missed diagnosis is immense in terms of burden on limited health resources and patientsâ€™ suffering. Therefore, its clinical spectrum requires constant reappraisal to update our physicians with current knowledge. This study was carried out to determine the changes in clinical pattern of typhoid fever.Clinical presentation of most typhoid fever still conforms with the classic pattern. High fever, anorexia, coated tongue, diarrhoea, relative leucopenia and hepatosplenomegaly are still common manifestations of typhoid fever. So, majority of the patients could be treated blindly based on clinical diagnosis. However, treatment should be given with first line of drugs like cefexime or ceftriaxone. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>There is strong political pressure to curb the high and rising healthcare expenditures. ICT is expected to play a vital role here, given its potential to increase cooperation and communication among and across the many actors in the healthcare sector. Given that work routines are tied up in existing, semiindependent information systems, this pressure for closer and more efficient cooperation translates into a corresponding pressure to integrate the information systems. Drawing on an empirical case of increased cooperation and efficiency from a hospital in Norway, we critically analyze the tendency to conflate – and ultimately misconstrue - the technical issue of integration with the organizational effects of cooperation and collaboration. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper discusses the foundations for establishing a viable and sustainable ICT industry and the opportunities it offers against the challenges many African countries face in their concerted efforts to participate fully in the information society and knowledge economy. Key ICT Policy thrusts are discussed focusing on the ICT as a sector, egovernment, e-governance and the education and training sectors. It is important to emphasize the need for government to be e-literate in order to competently manage and monitor the ICT sector. It is reaffirmed that ICT is crosscutting and an enabler for growth and development and for maximum benefit, countries must establish the right policy interventions, resource investments, appropriate networks (partnerships) and enabling environment. Four case studies that assist in mitigating effects of poverty and e-literacy are briefly discussed in order to show the impact of ICTs in agriculture, egovernment and rural districts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Indoor air pollution from biomass smoke is now regarded as public health hazard in the developing world, where more than two billion people still rely on the use of solid biomass fuels such as, dung, wood, crop residue and coal for cooking daily meals and heating homes. A crosssectional study was designed and conducted from March to June 2007, in Madla, a rural area,and in Thanthania, an urban area, under Bogra District of Bangladesh, to see and compare the prevalence of respiratory disease among female biomass fuel users and gas/electricity fuel users. A total of 103 females from the rural households meeting the defined enrollment criteria for biomass fuel group were selected purposively as cases, while 101 females from the urban households meeting the defined eligibility criteria for controls were included in gas/electricity fuel group. The participants were interviewed on a semi-structured questionnaire. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This is a draft strategy describing how the Victorian Government will design and use information and technology to deliver better government services. It provides high‐level direction on the management and use of information and communications technology (ICT). In June 2012, the Assistant Treasurer established the Victorian Information and Communications Technology Advisory Committee (VICTAC) and tasked it with overseeing the development of a Victorian Government ICT strategy. The committee is led by an independent chair and includes representatives from the Victorian Government, the ICT industry, and corporate Chief Information Officers (CIOs). In the development of this draft, VICTAC has sought feedback from within Government and from external advisors, industry stakeholders, and now the public. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), meant to address verity of issues ranging from extreme poverty to environmental sustainability have been offering handful of help to the most deprived sections to combat there exclusion. Use of innovative technologies is given utmost priority in most of the world in order to acquire resources to tackle the aimed issues under MDGs approach. Some of the pioneering individuals across the globe have been using their entrepreneurial capabilities in order to strengthen the given objectives. The use of innovative social entrepreneurial ventures at the greatest possible levels has become the most vibrant option in order to show the difference in achieving the MDGs as their role in the rebuilding modern societies is quite apposite. A socially entrepreneurial venture by name Barefoot College located in rural Rajasthan is studied in order to understand and learn the possibilities to replicate the model in other backward areas in order to achieve the MDGs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The inventive march of human efforts in ICT in the “modern” and “post – colonial” era have shown new dimensions to the development work, knowledge and information exchange and many other networking facilities. Today, ICTs are no longer considered as merely a “technical appendix” for internal computational needs. Being intrinsically divorced from the geographical constraints, today, the power of Internet is being used from electronic commerce (e-Commerce) and assistance to small and medium sized entrepreneurs to the empowerment of communities, women and youth; from the promotion of good governance and decentralization to the awareness campaigns for human rights and democracy; from long distance education to telemedicine to environment management, to foster and facilitate sustainable human development; to assist in the fight against poverty &amp; strengthen informed &amp; participatory decision-making at the policy &amp; planning levels. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Vietnam is likely to be among the countries hardest hit by climate change, threatening its legacy as a champion in leveraging agriculture for development. This discussion paper examines how a changing climate may affect rice production and how Vietnamese farmers could to adapt to various climatic conditions using an innovative yield function approach. The model addresses common methodological problems in the yield function estimation, including sample selection, endogeneity and heterogeneity. The results suggest that although climate change can potentially reduce rice production, farmers will respond mainly by adjusting the production portfolio and levels of input use. However, investments in rural infrastructure and human capital will have to support farmers in the adaptation process, if production levels and farm incomes are to be sustained in the future. The paper concludes with major findings and policy implications. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAC Working Paper 51&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lídia Cabral and Alex Shankland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper summarises the findings of a scoping study on Brazilian development cooperation in agriculture in Africa. The study comprised, in the first instance, a review of the relevant literature and interviews with key informants in Brazil, undertaken between October 2011 and March 2012. This was complemented by an international seminar on the topic held in Brasília on May 2012, which brought together experts and practitioners from Brazil, Africa, China and Europe to discuss Brazilian agricultural cooperation in the context of South-South engagements with Africa. The seminar represented a unique opportunity to gather and contrast experiences and viewpoints on the subject across a wide range of state and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is structured into five sections. This brief introduction is followed by an overview of the general features of Brazilian cooperation, including its drivers, principles, modalities and institutional setting. Section 2 describes cooperation with the African continent, with particular focus on its agriculture component and its growing significance. The fourth section offers some preliminary observations and hypotheses for further investigation. Section 5 concludes with some suggestions for the subsequent stage of the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>At the time this assessment was written, estimates suggested that up to 90,000 Syrian refugees had crossed the border into Lebanon. The International Rescue Committee conducted a rapid assessment on the situation faced by Syrian women and girl refugees in Lebanon, and came up with a number of key findings related to violence. Rape and sexual violence was often reported, with many stories of women and girls being tortured and raped, in their homes and in prison, often in front of family members. Linked to this is an increase in early marriage, as a way to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; girls from rape and violence. Intimate partner violence was reported as increasing since the conflict, due to men&amp;rsquo;s stress and feelings of powerlessness. Survival sex was also noted, with women and girls being forced to sell sex in exchange for food, accommodation or services. Many women reported that they were not accessing services in Lebanon for fear of violence and mistreatment by service providers. There were also concerns about women&amp;rsquo;s safety when travelling to locations where help is offered, and in the accommodation where they have settled. In addition, women survivors of sexual violence faced an extra level of danger; they feared their families would reject or kill them, or that they would be married to family members for reasons of &amp;ldquo;honour&amp;rdquo;. The assessment has four recommendations: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Syrian refugee women and girls need access to health and emotional support services &lt;br /&gt;2. Local health providers need technical assistance to increase access to services for survivors of gender based violence &lt;br /&gt;3. Women and girls need material goods and economic support to increase their social and economic capital and mitigate the risks they face &lt;br /&gt;4. GBV coordination structures should be developed or adapted &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report concludes by noting that many of the Syrian refugee women and girls in Lebanon have experienced multiple forms of gender based violence, but it is evident that many are not disclosing this or seeking help due to stigma, exposure to more violence, and barriers to accessing services. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Brief presents a concise overview of the Latin American (LA) gas industry, focusing on its policy experience and performance. In particular, it reviews the advantages and disadvantages of the region’s three different policy models: state-led, private and state-private. It describes the evidence suggesting that in LA the state-private model has been most economically and politically successful. Finally, it discusses the focus on regional integration that is a particular feature of the LA case. The lessons learned will be useful for African and South Asian policymakers interested in boosting their own gas sectors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report gives an overview of the current state of mobile phone use and services in East Africa. It outlines major trends and main obstacles for increased use as well as key opportunities and potential for scaling-up mobile applications. The report draws on secondary data and statistics as well as field work carried out in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya during 2008 and 2009. The report identifies relevant applications in an East African context for reaching and empowering the poor and contribute to social and economic development. The identified mobile applications, listed in Appendix 2, range from small pilots to scaled-up initiatives – from simple agricultural, market or health information services to fairly advanced financial and government transaction services. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAC Working Paper 50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dawit Alemu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased importance of South-South cooperation in rural and agricultural development, and especially the increased role of BRICS countries, has been debated in relation to international development assistance, specifically in terms of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i) the modalities and policies for agricultural development deployed, including officially articulated cooperation principles and visions and priorities for agricultural development&lt;br /&gt; (ii) the main actors in the cooperation process&lt;br /&gt; (iii) the explicit and implicit rationales for the modalities that underpin technical cooperation in agriculture&lt;br /&gt; (iv) the lessons for established donors, and&lt;br /&gt; (iv) local perceptions of the value added of the approaches deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper provides an overview of rural and agricultural development cooperation and tries to answer these questions for the case of Brazilian and Chinese agricultural development cooperation activities in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) promotes harmonisation and an alignment process of donor support through the Ethiopian High Level Forum, with nine subsidiary sector-specific working groups. Brazil and China are not engaged in any of the nine government-donor coordination platforms including the platform for agriculture, natural resource management and food security, which is called the Rural Economic Development and Food Security Sector Working Group (RED&amp;amp;FS SWG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Brazil and China are engaged as bilateral development partners in Ethiopia, mainly in the form of experience sharing in public governance, technical cooperation, and attraction of private and public investments. Moreover, the cooperation has very specific characteristics in that, in the case of Brazil, the GoE focuses on renewable energy sector development mainly related to biofuels, whilst in the case of China, cooperation is more focused on agricultural technology and skill transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper first presents an overview of the cooperation in rural development in Ethiopia, followed by documentation of the level of engagement by Brazil and China in the major areas of cooperation, i.e. experience sharing in public governance, technical cooperation and strengthening private investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The efficiency and effectiveness of a country&amp;rsquo;s public sector is vital to its development, where poorly performing state-owned enterprise (SOEs) absorb large amounts of scarce capital, on which they provide very low returns. This paper shows that Kiribati and Tuvalu (two Pacific states) both have SOEs that were established to provide essential infrastructure services, but their SOE losses had mounted over several years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper, nevertheless, reveals that despite initial conditions which made SOE reform exceedingly difficult, considerable progress has been registered in both states. In this framework, it notes that good starts have been made at SOE reforms, and there are signs that financial performance is improving. Yet, it notices that external ongoing support will be required in the future to help the governments keep rationalising their roles and put retained SOEs on a sound commercial footing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons from the SOE reform experience of Kiribati and Tuvalu include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a strong and active SOE reform advocate is a key factor in achieving success&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;giving SOEs a clear commercial mandate is a fundamental basis for improving their performance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reform needs to focus both on improving the immediate financial performance of key SOEs and on strengthening the rules and regulations under which all SOEs operate&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;formal plans for business improvement need to be realistic and have their implementation closely monitored by both the SOE board and external monitors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;subsequently, an SOE monitoring and advisory unit is essential if government is to provide arm&amp;rsquo;s length management and oversight of SOEs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the author indicates that when donors are involved, an agreement on an SOE policy framework needs to be secured, including criteria for identifying which enterprises should be government-owned and how obligations will be handled. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Some of the possible roles of ICT in higher education in the face of these challenges discussed in this paper are what and how students learn, when and where students learn, who the new faces of students and lecturers are, and ways to reduce the cost of education. However, research-based knowledge on how ICT has been and can be used to enhance the design, delivery and management of higher education programs in the Southeast Asia region is not readily available. Furthermore, countries in Southeast Asia are at different stages of development in the use of ICT in education. Thus, success stories, experiences and lessons learnt from the use of ICT in higher education will be of immense importance for educators and administrators who are at the forefront of integrating ICT for higher education in countries in the region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Vasculitis may be defined as the inflammation involving the blood vessel wall. Most types of vasculitis in children are rare, with the exception of Henoch-Schonlein purpura(HSP) and Kawasaki disease.1 Vasculitis can involve vessels of any size and can affect any organ system. The clinical presentation varies according to the histological type, the size of the involved blood vessel segment and the distribution of the involved vessels.2 This blood vessels inflammation may lead to tissue injury from vascular stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, or rupture.3 New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and validation

It is predominantly in these areas, where a vicious circle of poor health, inequality and social exclusion prevent people from participating in other aspects of society that can improve their quality of life. Improving health in the community, rural access to resources and the qualitative improvement of basic medical services that are needed to tackle these adverse conditions, are central to IICD’s health programmes. IICD is currently supporting 24 projects in the health sector. We are reaching around 55,000 medical workers, of whom 67% are women and approximately 830,000 beneficiaries, 82% of whom are located in rural areas. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The negative effects of climate change on agriculture and food security depend not only on changing climate conditions, but also on the agricultural sector’s ability to adapt through changes in technology and demand for food. This paper argues that eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 will require both regional and global research efforts, as well as concrete actions among which biotechnology adoption plays a key role. The paper reviews research on climate change and the increasing food insecurity situation in sub-Saharan Africa, and the significance of plant biotechnology in reversing this trend. To move plant biotechnology forward, it recommends that African countries institutionalise effective bio-safety regulatory frameworks and commit resources to capacity building and provision of infrastructure for biotechnology development. Researchers should also engage in education and communication with the general public to enhance adoption of biotechnological products in Africa. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report provides a comprehensive view of gender in Nigeria. It assesses progress in key areas, including: employment and livelihoods, education and health, political representation, and violence. It finds that women and girls suffer systematic disadvantage and discrimination that is magnified for those in the poorest States and sectors of society. It recommends policies to improve the lives of women and girls and identifies priorities for action. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The world's poorest people lack both capital and skills and are trapped in low return occupations.Whether their economic lives can be transformed by programmes which attempt to tackle both
constraints by providing assets and training to enable them to run small businesses is however unknown. To shed light on this issue we conduct a randomized evaluation of an entrepreneurship
programme that provides assets and training to the poorest women in rural Bangladesh. We find that the programme transforms the occupational choices of the poor women who participated in the programme by inducing them to spend more time in self-employment, less in wage labour and increases their labour
market participation, leading to a 36% increase in annual income on average. Moreover, the programme leads to an increase in wages at the village level and its effects spillover to other poor women who experience an increase in labour supply and income. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>With the aim to involve civil society organisations, policy makers, experts and researchers in the field of gender based violence, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) organized and moderated an online discussion on the critical gaps and challenges in prevention and multisectoral services and responses to violence against women and girls. The aim of the online discussion was to provide a forum for discussion between different stakeholders; identify measures taken and good practices from different parts of the world and in diverse resource settings in the two key areas of focus; and identify any emerging issues and practices that should be considered. This report, also available in French and Spanish, is the summary of the discussion. Rather than being a comprehensive mapping exercise, it aims to reflect many of the key concerns and priorities of practitioners working in this field on the ground. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key findings in the violence prevention discussion included: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; policy makers, public servants and traditional leaders are not gender sensitized; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; efforts to address prevention are uncoordinated, ill-funded and rarely monitored; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; context-sensitive responses require more research on attitudes and behaviours; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; key strategic groups and influencers are being neglected; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; cultural change is not addressed in remote or marginalized communities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key findings in the multisectoral services and responses discussion included: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Services remain uneven in quality, longevity and sustainability; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Many services are not well regulated, and do not take a rights-based approach; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Services need to be more broadly distributed, and preceded by comprehensive outreach; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Service staff and policy makers need to be better trained and sensitized; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Services must be better designed for children and girls, and for women subject to multiple forms of discrimination &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A range of recommendations have been suggested including: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; violence prevention must become a State priority as governments play an essential role in leading, coordinating and promoting accountability in the field of prevention &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; a better understanding of the multiple causes of gender-based violence, the intersections between different types of violence and trajectories of change must be built &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Services need to be more broadly distributed, and preceded by comprehensive outreach to women on their rights and the services available, and more work must be done to change mindsets &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; More training and gender-sensitisation must be in place for frontline service providers and police officers &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Services must be better designed for children and girls, and for women subject to multiple forms of discrimination &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;French http://www.unwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EVAW-Online-Discussion-Report_FR.pdf &lt;br /&gt;Spanish http://www.unwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EVAW-Online-Discussion-Report_SP.pdf &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The series of recent economic sanctions against Syria imposed by several countries and blocs sparkled the idea of a regional common market that comprises Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. This paper looks into the actual possibility of establishing this market, and investigates the horizons and opportunities that could be materialised in this context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that it is useful for Syria on the long run to establish a common market that extends from Lebanon to Iran, but currently, it should advance its bilateral trade with each of the other three countries. In addition, the document indicates that such market should be planed carefully, and reached gradually from creating a free trade area to establishing a custom union, and then to developing a common market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the proposed regional market would afford the so-called &amp;ldquo;economies of scale&amp;rdquo;, which reduce the production costs and increase the competitive advantages of the region&amp;rsquo;s products&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Syria&amp;rsquo;s agricultural sector would benefit from this common market much more than its counterparts in the other three countries &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Iraq would be the most important trade partner for Syria in this market; therefore, Syria should focus on this from now&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reasons causing Syrian-Iranian &amp;ldquo;terms of trade&amp;rdquo; to be increasingly in favour of Iran rather than in favour of Syria should be investigated, and relevant resolutions to re-balance this trend should be examined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author also suggests increasing the exportation of Syrian cheese and pastry to Lebanese and Iraqi markets on the short term, as well as cotton lint to Iranian markets. Moreover, he recommends Syria to plan for exporting cereals to Iraq and citruses to Iran on the long run, but he underlines that improving the competitiveness of these two sectors should be achieved before. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Traditional forage conservation, locally known as “ngitili”, which involves retaining an area of standing vegetation from the beginning of rainy season and opening it up for grazing at the peak of dry season, has become an important strategy for rangeland rehabilitation in the north-western semi-arid part of Tanzania. The present study assessed the current rangeland management practices, the role of indigenous knowledge on ngitili conservation and perceptions of agropastoralists on communal resources management. Data were collected from a total of 10 villages of Shinyanga rural and Meatu district. Interviewed agro-pastoralists claimed that, unequal sharing of benefits accrued from communal resources and poor management of communal ngitili lead to the preference of private ngitili to communal ones. The contribution of indigenous knowledge of Sukuma people lead to the success of ngitili conservation. However, the sustainability of this vital local knowledge is questionable. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the commercial world, companies refer to &amp;ldquo;unique selling points&amp;rdquo; to justify their existence. In the case of the five UN regional commissions, there is nothing comparable. If they disappeared, it is difficult to imagine which if any of their activities could not be assumed by the myriad regional and sub- regional structures of the other two-dozen UN development organizations, or the well-resourced regional development banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The harsh reality for the regional commissions has been that without significant amounts of resources for regional reconstruction, institution-building, or the creation of infrastructure, their achievements in terms of fostering regional cooperation have been minimal. Much of their activity consists of convening meetings&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;usually of government officials and experts from their region&amp;mdash; which generally result in declarations and agreements of limited practical significance. For various reasons, even the role of the commissions in mobilizing and giving voice to regional opinions has been marginal. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Population ageing affects growth through savings, capital accumulation, labour force participation, and total factor productivity. This paper examines the impact of ageing on those four channels in 12 developing Asian economies that collectively make up the bulk of the region&amp;rsquo;s population and output. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document points that the lag between mortality and fertility declines in Asian countries gave rise to a baby boom generation that was larger than the cohorts that preceded and followed it. However, when the baby boomers reach working age, both the savings rate and the size of the labour force will shoot up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions contain: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;while developing Asia is following in the demographic footsteps of the advanced economies, the scale of the transition make preparing for a &amp;ldquo;grayer&amp;rdquo; future all the more challenging and complex &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is projected that the region&amp;rsquo;s demographic transition will have a substantial adverse effect on its economic growth in the next 2 decades, particularly where population ageing is more advanced&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thus, the demographic dividend that drove economic growth in the past will turn into a demographic tax that will subtract from it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper underlines that a particular challenging issue will be to provide adequate income support and healthcare for the elderly without jeopardising growth by imposing excessive burdens on the working-age population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a primary means of sustaining economic growth in the future will be successful adaptations to rapidly changing population structures&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;additionally, working longer and encouraging more women to participate in the labour force can mitigate the negative impact of ageing on growth&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines the presence of potential bias arising from multiple sources of endogenous matching among the landlords, tenants and activities while choosing between crop sharing contract and fixed rent contract in the agricultural farming system. The study addresses this endogenous matching problem using data from rice farmers in rural Bangladesh. Although risk sharing explanation is found consistent with naïve estimation after controlling for possible sources of matching, it is found not to have significant influence on choosing a particular tenancy contract. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper tries to identify the common technology driven banking services provided by the banks in Bangladesh; their present condition, future prospects and challenges. Out of 47 schedule banks, 38 banks are selected for this study. It is found that the Foreign Commercial Banks and a few Private Commercial Banks are playing a significant role in providing technology driven banking services. Though technology driven banking is at present facing some challenges, it shows promise for the future. Without this type of banking it will not be possible for the Bangladeshi banks' to survive in a competitive global business environment. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As a member of the international community, Nigeria is not shielded from globalization. However, the country is exposed to both the positive and negative effects of globalization. This paper examines the negative effects of globalization on Nigeria by focusing on its impact on science and technology and the environment. It argues that although globalization presents many opportunities, it also exposes developing countries like Nigeria to many new challenges. The paper also suggests ways by which the negative effects of globalization can be addressed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the innovative adaptive measures used by farmers in northern Nigeria to respond to the effects of climate change. Quantitative and qualitative approaches (rapid rural appraisal, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews) were used to gather information from 500 farmers. The findings indicate that 84 per cent and 79 per cent of the farmers were aware and knowledgeable of climate change issues, respectively, while 81 per cent of them noted that they had experienced climate change incidences. The paper highlights adaptive measures used by the farmers in northern Nigeria, including: changes in planting and harvesting dates, multiple cropping, intensive manure application, shift to different sites and use of wetland/river valley (fadama) for farming. The study concludes that there is a need for the government to make concrete efforts to enact appropriate policies on climate change adaptation and assist local farmers to improve their resilience. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This note argues that tied targeted microcredit for raising livestock is not likely to be a successful tool for livestock development if borrowers do not have comparative advantage in livestock rearing and lenders have little incentive to monitor the proper use of credit by the “right” households for the “right” kind of activities. It also examines issues of mis-targeting, mis-use and weak monitoring on the basis of the findings from the impact study of the second phase of Participatory Livestock Development Project (PLDP-II) carried out by the BIDS. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Democratic governance mechanisms are becoming more receptive to the potentials of information communication technologies (ICT) to achieve good governance in its implementation. This application of ICTs for governance is covered under the umbrella term of ‘e-governance’. E-Governance is expected to maximise citizen satisfaction by not just improving responsiveness of public service delivery mechanisms but also by augmenting citizens’ participation in governance mechanisms (Gilmore &amp; D’Souza, 20061). Certainly for any e-governance initiative to be totally acceptable, citizens’ needs and aspirations need to be its starting point and the core nuclei (Saxena, 20052). However, the reality seems to its contrary, more specifically in the rural areas of developing countries such as India. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Various stakeholders in international development co-operation projects have presented frameworks for managing those projects. Each framework has different strengths and weaknesses, and they vary from highly abstract to relatively practical. However, none of those frameworks pays attention to situations where professionals are unable to identify possible risk sources due to insufficient information about the project milieu. Yet, such situations are common in international development co-operation projects where information technology (IT) is involved, and where IT professionals have to operate in an unfamiliar project milieu. This article presents a risk identification tool that is aimed at assisting IT professionals and organizations to identify sources of challenges in international development co-operation projects, and to design appropriate countermeasures for overcoming risks before the project enters the implementation phase. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines per capita income convergence across six divisions â€“ Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet, and Barisal âˆ’ in Bangladesh using annual data covering 1977-2000. The methodology uses ordinary least squares as well as time series approach, specifically unit root and cointegration techniques. The findings, however, do not provide enough evidence in favor of the convergence hypothesis even though the regions have similar socio-economic background, physical infrastructure, and access to the same financial system, administrative institutions, and technology. The series of income deviations from the benchmark fail to reject the null of non-stationarity in most cases. However, the presence of cointegration between various economic factors and the leading regions suggests the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among them. Therefore, proper attention in terms of providing infrastructural as well as technological and financial support to the lagging regions may b &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Brazil’s social protection policy, and in particular its Bolsa Familia programme, has been much discussed as a potentially valuable export to other rising powers, as well as to low-income countries looking to implement rights-based social protection policy. At the time of its establishment, in 2004, bringing together the Ministry of Social Assistance, the Bolsa Família Executive Secretariat and the Special Ministry of Food Security and the Fight Against Hunger, the MDS became responsible for 21 ongoing programs. This publication contains the first results of a set of studies evaluating programs of the Ministry of Social Development and the Fight Against Hunger (MDS). Evaluation considerations included: what was desired or necessary to be known about a given program or policy; the desired and feasible deadline for achievement of results; financial resources available; and access to reliable databases. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>United Nations Member States unanimously agreed in 1992 in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that ‘women have a vital role in environmental management and development. Their full participation is therefore essential to achieve sustainable development.' This publication highlights commitments made on gender equality and explores women’s contributions to sustainable development and policy around the world. Focusing on priority areas (safe drinking water and sanitation, food security and sustainable agriculture, sustainable cities, decent work and the green economy, health and education), it details the actions needed to establish a gender-responsive development framework and ensure an enabling environment for women’s full participation in sustainable development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of recent developments in poverty and income inequality in Thailand, summarising the government&amp;rsquo;s programs to address it, and highlighting the importance of microfinance sector as a key priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author clarifies that despite Thailand having been very successful in lowering the national incidence of poverty, significant pockets of subnational poverty remain. Moreover, income inequality in Thailand is among the highest in Southeast Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;differences in regional per capita incomes are the key determinant of poverty and inter-regional income inequality in Thailand&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;this suggests that government interventions to address inequality should be a combination of economy-wide, region-specific, and sector-specific initiatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document figures that while government programs have expanded microcredit, low-income families still have limited access to financial services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it will be important for the government strategy for financial inclusion to include time-bound measures to open the microfinance sector to greater private sector participation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the strategy should also include measures to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to promote the growth of micro-insurance products&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the government should develop a national financial literacy program aimed at low-income households&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the government should establish a national social protection commission with a mandate to oversee the review of poverty reduction programs &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the government should examine the feasibility of introducing the programs on conditional cash transfer (CCT) in the poorer regions &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the government should carry out further analytical research on labour market informality in the poorer regions, to better understand youth labour market experience and poverty &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAC Working Paper 47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Stephen Spratt&lt;br /&gt;January 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price volatility is exacerbated by the tendency of market actors to follow momentum strategies, where price rises encourage more buying, and falls encourage selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the impacts of this activity with respect to global food prices, in order to understand the relationship between financial markets and food price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It examines how the relationship between financial actors and food commodity markets – particularly futures markets – changed in the last ten years. The paper also explores the benefits and costs of the increased role of financial sector actors in these markets,  and how the balance between benefits and costs might change in the future. Further, it asks what reforms, if any, are needed to ensure that benefits exceed costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper establishes the context in terms of price movements and the evolution of food and financial markets over the past decade, and develops a typology of speculation as a framework for thinking about these issues. It goes on to apply this typology to global food markets, and reviews the differing explanations for food price movements. The author also considers the role of uncertainty and complexity, and the role of financial markets in this regard, and considers some policy options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The project titled ‘Sensitizing communities on CEDAW’ was a part of the Gender Quality Action Learning (GQAL) programme implemented in Gazipur to sensitize people about CEDAW to prevent violence against women and sexual harassment.
The study aimed to assess the change of knowledge level of students and community leaders on CEDAW and sexual harassment. Two rounds of survey data –baseline and endline - were used to assess the change of the project. The difference
in changing knowledge level of the respondents on CEDAW and sexual harassment between the baseline and endline survey was found to be much higher. Still there was considerable number of respondents whose knowledge was found to be unchanged or decreased after the intervention. Deeply rooted patriarchal ideology,
cultural beliefs and practices were identified as the major reasons behind this fact.It was suggested that BRAC should run this kind of project in a larger scale, targeting larger groups of population for a longer period &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>South Africa faces major challenges. Although the institutionalized system of racism known as apartheid was formally abolished in 1994, its legacy lingers. Crime, economic inequality and an inferior educational system continue to plague the country’s citizens. In addition, an estimated 5.7 million people are affected by HIV – the highest of any country in the world. Major challenges include hunger, domestic and agricultural chores, the cost of school uniforms and other fees, disability, HIV/AIDS and teen pregnancy. These prevent students from accessing a quality education. Furthermore, violence and insecurity, both inside and outside school walls create enormous obstacles for learners. This report present an initiative – developing protective spaces within the context of a child-friendly educational system. This initiative was launched in 2004 in an attempt to bolster children's ability to access a rights-based education. 585 target schools were identified. The impact is also discussed &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Health Care sector in India has witnessed significant growth during the last few years, both in quality and capacity. In spite of such developments, heath care facilities in the country remain inadequate to meet the needs of the citizens, particularly in rural areas, where approximately 70% of the people live. To address this problem, the government has launched major national initiatives such as National Rural Health Mission, establishment of six new AIIMS like institutions, up gradation of existing public hospitals and labs, etc. As the health sector is poised for major growth in next decade, the sheer size of healthcare sector in the country will necessitate extensive use of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, services and databases for policy planning and implementation. Such a framework would require services based on inter-operable and sharable technology, connecting various institutions and service providers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Natural hazards continue to cause significant loss of life in Asia and the Pacific, yet there is increasing public awareness of the need to strengthen disaster resilience at all levels of society. This paper argues that as long as investment in resilience and investment in development are still regarded as two separate issues, disaster risk will continue to accumulate and losses to expand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report encourages investors to integrate investments in resilience into their own areas and modes of work, considering five key themes and sectors of particular relevance in strengthening resilience:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;livelihoods, where investment in resilience of the poor and near-poor can lead directly to poverty reduction&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;land use planning, where the integration of disaster risk considerations into the existing process represents a fundamental first step in strengthening resilience&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;transport, as the siting and satisfactory functioning of such infrastructure plays a central role in determining the location and continuing productivity of many other development investments&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;education, where investment in resilience translates into a direct trans-generational investment in the future of a country&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;housing, a centerpiece of social fabric and human security disaster risk financing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;disaster risk financing, which is of particular relevance in strengthening resilience in Asia and the Pacific &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, the report identifies some critical next steps:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;governments may review and revise disaster risk management legislative and regulatory frameworks, clarifying different responsibilities and ensuring that some form of disaster risk assessment is undertaken for all new investments &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;governments can develop programs of work to strengthen private sector understanding and appreciation of the commercial opportunities in strengthening resilience&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;governments and regional associations can establish a regional knowledge-development, including an open-source, regional, online information platform, and capacity-building program &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author points that detailed frameworks can be developed to monitor and evaluate progress, suggesting some indicators in this context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper aims to provide the kind of disaggregated data required to identify areas of inequity in access to ICTs between men and women and any differences in their usage at the national level and comparatively across countries. This should provide a basis for policy makers to develop interventions aimed at ensuring greater gender equity in relation to access and usage of ICTs. The analysis of the data also reveals other, perhaps overriding, inequities that point to the fact that poor women may have more in common with poor men in their own and other countries than with less marginalised women in their own and other countries. The paper is based on the Research ICT Africa (RIA) Household and Individual Access and Usage survey conducted in 17 African countries during 2007 and 2008, and on focus group studies that were conducted across five African countries to gain a greater qualitative understanding of access to and usage of ICTs from a gender perspective. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The emergence of BRICS represents an important change in the global political economy. There is anticipation that the BRICS &amp;ndash; building on their own lessons and initiatives &amp;ndash; will play a progressive role on economic and social issues at regional and global levels. The critical view&amp;nbsp; includes doubts about the nature and coherence of the group. There is also concern that the economic agenda of BRICS could pose new challenges to human rights and development, particularly given the absence domestic frameworks for accountability on international engagements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these concerns, the debate on poverty and inequality is integral to any engagement with the BRICS, given its focus on growth and infrastructure. BRICS-led aid and investment activities are expected to have a significant bearing on issues such as the exploitation of natural resources, land grabs, agriculture and food security across regions. There is a growing awareness that civil society in BRICS countries must build a broader agenda of rights and accountability around the international roles of their government and private sector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper explores ideas and insights for civil society engagement with the BRICS agenda, based largely on interviews held with 34 representatives of the development sector, academia and media within BRICS countries and outside. Forty-four per cent of those interviewed are linked to work with women and socially excluded groups. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>At the Horticulture Farm, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh to study the field performance, variability, characters association and genetic divergence of 58 long type cucumber accessions. Wide variability was found for the plant characteristics of days to seed germination, vine length harvest, petiole length and yield contributing characters namely, days to first male and female flowering, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight, fruit length and fruit diameter. Path analysis showed that the fruit length and diameter, average fruit weight and number of fruits per plant directly contributed towards the yield per plant in the long type cucumber. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

It also includes abundance of statistical charts, highlights and annexes which give detailed background information and data. Since there is relatively little work in this field, I hope, beyond its initial audience in aid agencies, the report will provide a comprehensive picture of DAC Members' financing ICTD activities and serve as background document for the TFFM and further inter-governmental negotiations in the preparatory process of WSIS Tunis 2005. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this era of globalization and rapid expansion of world economy,intellectual property and the corresponding rights over intellectual property are crucial to the economic,social and technological development of any country beyond doubt.Globalization also has made the intellectual property rights a subject matter of international concern.All nations who want to promote and project their development in all aspects must protect the rights over intellectual property by granting legal veil through exclusive enactments.Realizing this fact,all industrialized nations and by now most developing countries of the world have enacted laws for the protection of 'works of minds'.To comply with the international obligations Bangladesh also has introduced intellectual property rights protection system.This research paper explores to seek how enforcement mechanisms in Bangladesh are intrinsically precious,effective and thenceforth,worth in protecting the rights of the IP holders. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper tests the implications of a model which gives a central role to luck − in the form of good versus bad draws − in the process of economic development. An obvious potential source of good versus bad draws is environmental volatility, particularly in the context of developing economies which tend to be heavily dependent on agricultural output. The study uses rainfall data and a finite mixture model to test the effect of environmental volatility on comparative economic development. It finds that climate variables exert a direct influence on income, even when institutions have been controlled for. The results show that poorer countries are vulnerable to environmental volatility, which appears to delay their takeoff to modern economic growth. The study implies that these results may have important implications for development policy and studies on the expected costs of future climate change. The paper also includes a revised definition of the takeoff concept. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Governments in a number of countries are trying to address concerns about land grabbing by closing their borders to foreign investors. Are these restrictions effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really, says GRAIN. They give the impression that something is being done at the highest level and appeal to nationalist or pro-sovereignty sentiments. But they are very narrow approaches to a complex problem and often full of back doors and loopholes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This chapter explores access to ICT training in Makerere University by gender. It focuses on selected examples showing the promotion of general access to ICT training in the university. Examples of the Department of Women and Gender Studies (DWGS) and the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology (FCIT) are utilised. The paper also analyses the efforts of the gender mainstreaming division (GMD). The division is charged with the role of mainstreaming gender into all aspects of the university, including gendering the ICT training process. In all, the measures aimed at promoting and / or improving access to ICT higher education are tackled. In this context, the purpose of this paper is twofold: one, to present good practices that can be emulated in developing relevant ICT training policies and practices in similar higher institutions of learning; and two, to make recommendations for possible utilisation by organisations and institutions of higher learning as well as governments. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>China’s relationship with resource-rich countries, especially Sudan and Angola, is well covered by the media and scholars. But other significant Chinese trade partners in Africa like Gabon – a key exporter of energy and mineral resources to China, and a beneficiary of Chinese investment, development co-operation and commercial engagement – are rarely studied, argues the author of this policy report. Assessing Sino-Gabonese relations, the author observes trends which are seen in other countries, such as supply contracts in exchange for infrastructure development. The Chinese cultivation of African elites as a means of securing access to previously excluded resources and markets is another dimension of this process. Also, local conditions and actors have influenced the structure of Chinese ties, including the controversial leasing of national park land to a Chinese oil exploration firm, and have produced some surprising outcomes in terms of transparency and accountable practices. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. This WHO guidance note gives a broad vision of what a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the national level, a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control is made up of several key components. These range from community education, social mobilisation, vaccination, screening, and treatment to palliative care. However, there is a need for more involvement of disciplines and national health programmes, such as immunisation, reproductive health, cancer control and adolescent health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions include: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in countries where human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is introduced, screening programmes will need to be developed or strengthened &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;prior to national introduction, countries are encouraged to pilot and assess vaccine delivery strategies in order to determine how to achieve affordable and high HPV vaccination coverage &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;careful analysis of the financial costs of both the vaccine and the delivery strategy will be a critical step in the decision-making process &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;strategies that reduce the number of clinic visits required for screening and treatment make it easier for women to receive the care they need, to increase follow-up and reduce programme costs &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is important to have strong systems in place to monitor national vaccination programmes coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In addition, the paper indicates that HPV vaccine introduction can be a potential catalyst for action in the following ways:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the development of a national cervical cancer prevention and control strategy &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;addressing cervical cancer prevention and control in a comprehensive manner that also promotes the sexual health of females over the life course and together with a package of other key health interventions &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ensuring coordination between immunisation, health education and cancer control programmes &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;generating support and advocacy for new resource mobilisation for cervical cancer prevention and control.&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>Canada held brief domestic consultations about improving market access for LDC products in the spring of 2002. These included a one-month window for responses to a notice published in the official gazette (March 30) and a government discussion paper, as well as parliamentary hearings on Canadian approaches to the next WTO round of negotiations. In June 2002, the government announced that all tariffs and quotas would be removed on all LDC products, except for dairy products, eggs and poultry.
The implications of the new Canadian scheme are the focus of this paper. Frequent reference is made to the situation in the US and the EU, by way of comparison. The US is of particular relevance, not just because it is such an important market for Bangladesh, but also given the increasing discussion in Canada about deepening economic integration with the US, and even a possible common market. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report highlights the major achievements that have been accomplished in connecting people via mobile technologies.
Today, mobile cellular networks already cover close to 90 per cent of the world population, and we expect coverage to reach 100 per cent by 2015. We are also confident that by 2015 more than half of the world population will be using a mobile telephone. At the same time, the report shows that, in a number of areas, substantial efforts need to be made to achieve the targets. Too many schools in developing countries continue to be deprived of access to the Internet, and three-quarters of people in the world are not yet online. Only a very small proportion of the information hosted by libraries and archives has been digitized, and even less is available online. The report also points to the persistent broadband divide, which policy-makers need to tackle urgently. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Three or more consecutive pregnancy losses are considered as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). About 1% of all pregnant women face this distressing problem and o.5% to 5% of spontaneous abortions are recurrent. Genetic, environmental, anatomic, hormonal, infectious and immunological factors are associated with RPL. Sometimes several factors might simultaneously be responsible for RPL. So diagnostic work up is to be extended. Life style changes, hormonal supplementation, anticoagulant and immunotherapy and surgical correction of certain uterine anatomic defects might help the couple to be parent. Genetic problem can be overcome by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and transferring good healthy embryos. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report explores the value of ICT4D from such a rights and empowerment perspective. Can ICTs enable people to actively challenge and change the power structures which keep them poor and marginalised? If so, what are the conditions for this to happen? Is the simple provision of access and training enough, or are there other dimensions that we need to be aware of and deal with?

The report is based on the experience of the Reflect ICTs project3, which has pilots in Burundi, India and Uganda and is now half way through its three-year life (2003–2005). It is a participatory ICT project, and the early experiences have given us valuable insight into the relationships between communication, power, exploitation and empowerment. I hope some of this learning and observation may be applicable to others in the field. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Poverty and gender disparities create obstacles to primary school enrolment. Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with more than 140 million people. With children under 15 years of age accounting for about 45% of the country’s population, the burden on education and other sectors is overwhelming. If Nigeria is to meet the millennium development goal of achieving gender parity in education by 2015, progress in girls’ school enrolment and attendance will have to be twice as rapid as it is now. This report presents an overview of the child-friendly school initiative, a collaborative approach between UNICEF and Nigeria Ministry of Education. The initial model schools were targeted towards Nigeria’s six northern states, whose overall level of enrolment was lowest and gender gap highest. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Policy-makers are often tasked with making difficult decisions in the face of an uncertain future outlook. Will infrastructural investments still be relevant in 25 years? What new markets are likely to emerge in the medium term? How will a gradual increase in average temperatures over the coming decades affect livelihood security? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though largely context specific, these are but three examples of the types of forward-looking questions that should be asked of many longer-term policies or plans. Despite this need, the development and humanitarian sectors continue to face criticisms over their relative rigidity and short-termism with regards to project funding and delivery. Recent emphasis on promoting a &amp;lsquo;resilience approach&amp;rsquo; to programming has resulted in calls for more longer-term objectives and deliverables, greater flexibility in planning processes, as well as better collaboration and coordination amongst key development actors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on insights from complexity science, this paper describes what processes are needed to promote Flexible and Forward-looking Decision Making (FFDM). More specifically, the paper proposes a coupled game and reflection based approach. This looks to capitalise on the ability of serious games to encourage experiential learning, as well as ensuring that enough time is provided to reflect on how key components of the game relate to the &amp;lsquo;real-world&amp;rsquo;. It also allows participants to identify their own routes forward for improving decision-making processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper lays the groundwork for the second phase of research under the Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance (ACCRA). ACCRA will be researching the principles outlined within, as well as trialling three separate coupled game-and reflection events across its core countries, namely Ethiopia, Uganda and Mozambique. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Malawi is one of the countries in Africa which is highly dependent on fish as a source of animal protein. Malawi produces about 70,000 tons of fish annually from its lakes, rivers and swamps. The fishing industry supports the livelihoods of 1.5 mill people in Malawi and contributes about 4% to the national GDP. With funding from the Norwegian MFA through the Lake Chilwa Climate Change Adaptation Programme, pilot value addition and fish marketing activities targeted at women groups were implemented in three sites. Self selected women groups were formed and trained in group dynamics, business management and fish processing. Experts introduced solar dryers and improved smoking kilns to the groups and conducted collaborative activities to demonstrate how adoption of these technologies could increase women incomes through production of high quality fish that could be sold to market outlets country wide at a higher price. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture is one of the major driving forces of the Bangladesh economy, providing employment to just under half the workforce and contributing around 20% towards national GDP; however, a significant proportion of those involved in agriculture, both as producers and labourers, live close to the poverty line. A major factor inhibiting their economic growth is their lack of access to relevant and timely information. The public sector has an impressive extension workforce which is delivering information to farmers. However, owing to resource limitations a vast number of 
farmers remain uncovered and fall out of this information loop. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study was a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted to evaluate the level of malnutrition and the impact of some socio-economic and demographic factors of households on the nutritional status of children under 3years of age in Botswana. 400 households and mothers of children representing 23 health regions of the country participated in the study. Results show that the level of wasting, stunting and underweight was 4.4%, 38.7% and 15.6% respectively. Malnutrition was significantly higher among boys than girls. Undernutrition was less prevalent among children whose parents worked in the agricultural sector than among children whose parents involved in informal business. Children brought up by single parents suffered from underweight significantly. The study findings imply that efforts for redressing child undernutrition issues in Botswana should focus on factors associated with development outcomes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Framework for Action on ICT for Development in the Pacific (FAIDP) outlines a new approach to developing and improving information and communication technology (ICT) services to support development, strengthen governance and improve the livelihoods of communities in the Pacific region. It acknowledges that national ICT policies and plans implemented through integrated and well coordinated approaches provide the principle means for ICT to contribute meaningfully to sustainable development. It promotes a ‘whole‐of‐sector’ approach, based on the concept of ‘many partners, one team’. This approach recognises that numerous stakeholders contribute to ICT development in the region and accepts them as equal partners. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Indigenous knowledge plays an important role in the way communities interact with their climate. However, according to this ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN), the increase of extreme weather events and disasters calls for new partnerships between indigenous people and the scientific community – an area where Bolivia could lead the way. The brief finds that indigenous people have reported that traditional climatic indicators are no longer as reliable as in the past and provide little protection against the impacts of severe weather on crops and livestock. Yet, indigenous knowledge can be combined with scientific methods to allow vulnerable populations to better adapt to climate change. The brief presents Bolivia’s Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra (Law of the Rights of Mother Earth) as an example of one important tool for indigenous people, which can also provide useful lessons to other countries and communities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This policy paper is the outcome of extensive and exhaustive deliberations by a Healthcare Sub-Committee constituted by the CII National Committee on Healthcare involving leading stakeholders in the Healthcare Industry. The recommendations in this document are based on a specific mandate provided to the sub-committee, which was to study the avenues of collaboration between the public and private sectors of the healthcare industry, and to recommend public policy initiatives that would foster Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and stimulate investment in healthcare sector to shape the future of Indian Healthcare Industry. The observations from the study indicate five major thrust areas where a Public-Private-Partnership could be evolved as a synergistic model to combine both the social objectives of universal healthcare access and the business objective of running a profitable healthcare facility. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Expenditures on healthcare in Asian and Pacific countries (APCs) are widely seen as financially burdensome to household budgets and contributing to impoverishment. This review examines the evidence on maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) care expenditures in APCs and looks into how and to what extent these expenditures exacerbate poverty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;although free MNCH services are widely offered in the region, maternal care is still very expensive in many APCs, and cost remains a major barrier to safe motherhood in these countries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;these financial costs appear to be major barriers to improving access to and use of MNCH services in many APCs, and contribute significantly to observed inequalities in access and MNCH outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, MNCH care expenditures do heighten poverty, not only through paying MNCH costs but also through the coping strategies that households may adopt (e.g. loans) &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in the final analysis, it seems that many households choose to forgo MNCH care to avoid the financial costs &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, there is limited evidence that community insurance schemes are successful in protecting the poor from the detrimental effects of MNCH expenditures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there is an urgent need across the Asia and Pacific region to increase public financing for MNCH care services in order to substantially expand access to services and to lessen the catastrophic impact of health expenditures&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;further research to develop more sensitive and accurate measures of opportunity costs would increase understanding of the overall cost of MNCH care to households&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>Malnutrition is a serious public health problem, particularly in developing countries linked to substantial increase in the risk of mortality and morbidity affecting mostly women and children. Rural disadvantage is a known factor, but little attention has been paid to rural-urban disparity among women. This paper aims at providing a reliable source of information for policy makers on malnutrition and rural-urban disparity. The data sources were the demographic health surveys of 26 countries conducted between 1995 and 2006. Meta analysis, meta regression, were carried out. It was concluded that the magnitude of rural-urban malnutrition disparity revealed provides a baseline that will be of assistance to clinicians, researchers and policy makers in the detection, prevention and treatment of malnutrition. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Wetlands and other aquatic ecosystems cover about 20 per cent of Malawiâ€™s surface area. The Elephant Marsh, a wetland in southern Malawi, is important for fishing, agriculture, hunting and the collection of natural resources for the livelihoods of local communities. However, there has been increasing pressure on the ecosystem driven by climate change, population growth, rural poverty and agricultural conversion, all of which threaten the future of the wetland. Currently, Malawi does not have either a national wetland policy or a climate change policy. This study aims to establish the development potentials of Elephant Marsh from an ecosystem-based perspective. It reveals that there are multiple development potentials in fisheries, agriculture, biomass for energy, conservation and tourism. The paper emphasises that as these opportunities are developed, there will be the need to strengthen management institutions at local and national levels, as well as the coordination between the two. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

This report finds that although the deforestation rates in the area have historically been low, the trend is likely to change dramatically due to the combination factors, including: demographic growth (and associated expansion of subsistence agriculture and fuelwood collection); and the development of the industrial, agriculture, transport, mining and energy sectors. This multi-sectoral analysis of the major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation provides the Congo Basin countries with an analytical tool to better understand the potential impacts of development of other sectors on the forest. A regional model allowed the countries to quantify the impact of ‘policy shocks’, such as increases in the demand of meat and biofuels. These shocks are likely to have significant impacts on forest loss. However, it seems that the Congo Basin would be less affected than the tropical forests or south east Asia and the Amazon. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Parliamentary oversight is one of the cornerstones of democracy. John Stuart Mill asserted that the most appropriate tasks of a representative body are to: oversee and clarify the government actions, compel the executive to provide explanations for its activities and jurisdiction for its deeds (Mill 1890). A comparative study by Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU 2007) defined Parliamentary oversight as the review, monitoring and supervision of government and public agencies including the implementation of policy and legislation". This definition emphasizes more on the nature and purpose of oversight rather than the oversight procedures. The robust monitoring of the executive by the parliament is an indicator of good governance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The article examined mainly the farmersâ€™ level of knowledge about environmental pollution due to unsafe use of pesticides in rice cultivation and factors influencing it and explored suitable ways of reducing their uses. Results showed that the majority of the farmers knew the harmful impacts of pesticides on fish, insect resistance, health of human and animals, soil and beneficial species superficially. Most of the farmers suggested that application of correct doses of agrochemicals, monitoring pests, timely removal of weeds and affected plants, creating awareness among farmers, improving technical knowledge of users and cultivation of pest tolerant varieties were necessary t reduce the quantity of pesticides in minimizing environmental hazards. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Brief sets out to understand why most anti-corruption initiatives fail, and what might be done about it. In particular it focuses on how the large 'design-reality gap' (the mismatch between the expectations built into their design as compared to on-the-ground realities in the context of their deployment) and explains that successfully implemented initiatives find ways to minimise or close these gaps. Beyond this, it examines how it is also the politics of the situation that determine the drivers to anti-corruption success. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Cities are challenged by a variety of environmental problems, most of which are associated with failures in the way urban growth is planned and managed. The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) set up the Focus Cities Research Initiative to address these urban management challenges. It was unusual in that it supported both research and action, and used multi-stakeholder teams to employ action-research and work in partnership with local government and civil society to identify solutions to environmental problems affecting urban dwellers, to implement them and to monitor the results.
This brief focuses on the three Latin American Focus Cities (FC) initiatives: Lima, Peru; Cochabamba, Bolivia; and
Moreno, Argentina. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the World We Want, this global e-discussion on gender equality was co-convened by UN Women and UNICEF in partnership with civil society as part of the global thematic consultation on addressing inequalities in the post-2015 development agenda. At the time this summary was written, hundreds of people had contributed to the gender equality e-discussion. This document highlights the most important issues and key messages from the conversation from 3 October to 2 November 2012. It reports that action is required in the following six priority areas: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Combat all forms of gender-based violence; &lt;br /&gt;2. Ensure women&amp;rsquo;s sexual and reproductive rights and access to quality healthcare; &lt;br /&gt;3. Enact and enforce laws that promote gender equality and eliminate laws, policies and practices that are harmful to women and girls; &lt;br /&gt;4. Prioritise access to quality education and skills development for all women and girls, especially those from socially excluded groups; &lt;br /&gt;5. Ensure women&amp;rsquo;s full participation in society, including in the economic, legal, social and political life of their communities; and &lt;br /&gt;6. Enact economic and social policies that contribute to achieving gender equality and align with human rights principles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the recommendations and conclusions are the following: &lt;br /&gt;- Gender equality cannot be limited to the aforementioned six priority areas; &lt;br /&gt;- An overhaul of the structures that produce and perpetuate gender inequality is needed; &lt;br /&gt;- Transformational change must be grounded in equality and non-discrimination principles, and recognise that gender equality can only be achieved if both women and men are involved and their rights fully realised; &lt;br /&gt;- There should be a transparent, inclusive and participatory process, facilitating the genuine participation of women and men, with mechanisms at local, national and global levels for setting priorities, monitoring progress and holding governments accountable; and &lt;br /&gt;- Gender equality should be fully integrated throughout the post-2015 development framework - with targets and indicators that capture outcomes by sex and by the intersection of gender with other forms of inequality. &lt;br /&gt;- There should be a specific goal that focuses on addressing the most widespread and fundamental forms of gender-based inequalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available in Englush, French and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>The NSW Government ICT Strategy 2012 is a culmination of the best minds in ICT in NSW Government, the private sector, and the community coming together to map a way forward. To tackle the issues that need to be tackled. To bring NSW out of the dark ages and into the 21st century. It is an ambitious strategy with no easy or quick fixes. It focuses on how we better use the $2 billion spent on ICT by the NSW Government every year to achieve our goals and defines a list of programs and initiatives to get there. Importantly, we aim to increase competition while reducing the time, costs and risks associated with the government ICT processes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is designed to look at the role of teacher talk and teacher-student interaction in the management of communicative English learning. In particular, the focus is given on the activities of the teachers in a communicative English language classroom. For the organization of the classroom, teacher talk is of crucial importance. The language which teachers use is important for the organization and management of a communicative English language classroom, because it is the medium through which teachers either succeed or fail to implement their teaching plans. In this paper I have tried to discuss the role of a teacher in a communicative way. Teachers have to play different roles in CLT classrooms; therefore I will focus on their functions in general and their problems in the context of Bangladesh in particular. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In Latin America’s mountain ranges in Central America and the Andes, strategies to build capacities for climate change adaptation have generally been participative in nature and have aimed at improving natural resource conservation, providing access to new technologies and capturing traditional knowledge and practices. A strong focus has also been on maintaining water resources and agrobiodiversity. This guide presents a range of experiences, publications and organisations from the region, concluding with lessons that could prove useful to other mountain regions of the world. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>During the last two decades, Bangladesh has made significant progress in improving access to primary education, especially for girls and poor children. In recent years, there is a growing awareness among various stakeholders that Bangladesh should focus not only on quantitative expansions of primary education, but also on improvement in the quality of education. This paper examines three main issues: 1) the performance of Bangladesh in primary education based on selected quantitative indicators; 2) the state of the quality of primary education in Bangladesh; and 3) development of inter-organizational synergy involving government and other organizations to promote quality education. The paper highlights the fact that the performance of Bangladesh has been impressive in gender parity compared to other South Asian countries. However, based on several criteria, Bangladesh appears to be lagging behind other countries in the quality of primary education. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mere diagnosis of Nager acrofacial dysostosis in neonatal period seeing only the craniofacial and limb defects and not performing the test for hearing may cause delayed detection of conductive deafness resulting in delayed speech and language development. Hearing aid for this problem can be proposed to the patient from early life to augment the speech development, if deafness can be detected early in the neonatal period. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In presence of immune factors (Rh Negative mother and Rh Positive father) NIHF is a very rare condition and due to its rarity / scarcity much information is not available. Though rare, obstetricians should keep in mind that Rh non-immunized mother without consanguineous marriage may give birth of a NIHF and should be diagnosed early during ANC and consider termination of pregnancy in non-correctable conditions of NIHF. Obstetrician also could make all reasonable efforts to find out the clue of etiologic agent and dealt accordingly. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This was a descriptive type of cross sectional study among 522 garments workers as respondents. It was aimed to identify morbidity pattern, duration of illness among garments workers and also to determine treatment seeking behavior during illness. The socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents were the points of investigations.The study findings highlight awareness program among factory owners and garments workers towards preventing infectious and chronic diseases as well as to undertake modern scientific treatment. Improved health care facilities in the garments factory may be considered for early detection and treatment of cases to avoid complications. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In recent decades, researchers and policymakers have increasingly emphasised the importance of the complex relationships between water, energy and food (also called the WEF nexus) that are often overlooked in narrowly focused actions, investments and policies. This paper summarises key arguments, approaches, frameworks and lessons learnt from global WEF initiatives. From this summary, the authors build on the information and experiences to develop a framework that would enable future developments to operationalise the WEF nexus to assist in guiding investments and designing policies in the particular context. The paper is aimed as a basis for discussion among experts working on the theoretical approaches and practical applications of WEF, in order to gather feedback and assist in improving approaches to integrating water, energy and food. As part of this goal, the paper proposes a four-step approach to implement such an integrated framework in the context of watershed ecosystems. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report summarises the implementation plans for the main phase of the Economic Impact Assessment of Climate Change in Key Sectors in Nepal study, including the approach and methods proposed. The primary objectives were to: provide headline and sectoral estimates of the impacts and economic costs of climate change for key sectors in Nepal (the agriculture and water sectors), and provide a ranking of climate compatible development options to address the risks identified in these areas. The approach proposed starts with the current and looks to the future. By considering development and sector plans, it also grounds the study in country and regional policy, assessing the risks of climate change to these plans and the actions needed to mainstream resilience. Finally the summary presents the proposals for capacity building in country, and stakeholder consultation and communication plans. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p class="MsoListParagraph"&gt;Climate change has become an increasingly important public health concern in China. This policy brief is part of the Adapting to Climate Change in China (ACCC) project's Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;rsquo;s (GDCDC) first comprehensive study of the health impacts of climate change and related adaptation policies in China. The briefing summarises findings from this research, including the following key messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Extreme climate events in the Guangdong province have increased the risk of mortality and infectious diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability to heat waves is higher in economically undeveloped regions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improved cooperation between meteorological and health departments is needed to build up monitoring systems on climate change and public health in the Guangdong province.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multi-sectoral early warning systems would significantly help to minimise adverse health impacts of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Risk communication strategies, education, awareness projects and adaptation policies should be developed at a provincial authority level to improve risk perception and further reduce the adverse health impacts of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The NPA has since 2007 implemented an Oil for the Common Good programme (OCG) with funding from Norad’s Oil for Development programme. The main purpose is to contribute to strengthening democratic control and participation in decision-making processes in petroleum producing countries. Competence building activities have been a major focus in the programme. This review was commissioned by the NPA. The main purpose is to assess the implementation of the programme with a particular focus on achievements and results in relation to objectives; the strengths and weaknesses; and the main challenges facing the programme. The assessment also addresses the relations between the programme and the NPA strategy and the country programmes in the country concerned, and provide recommendations for the next phase. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This manual was developed by the Women&amp;rsquo;s Learning Partnership, a group that trains and supports women in the global south, primarily in Muslim-majority countries, to become leaders and advocates for a just, peaceful world. The manual begins by explaining that despite positive legal and policy developments worldwide on ending violence against women and girls, there are many challenges in implementing laws on this area. For example, in many countries women have less access to legal and political systems than men. They are also, in many contexts, prevented from reporting violence because of cultural or traditional constraints. The fact that women are usually economically disadvantaged also means that their ability to escape or eliminate violence is lessened. The aim of the manual is to help close the gaps between legislation and the achievement on an operational level of women&amp;rsquo;s human rights. As an educational tool it examines the prevalent forms of violence against women around the world and it aims to spark conversation, build commitment and inspire activism to end gender based violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is divided into the following sections: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Violence in the private sphere &amp;ndash; covering abuse in the home, domestic workers, female genital mutilation, forced and early marriage, and &amp;lsquo;honour&amp;rsquo; crime. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Violence in the community &amp;ndash; covering sexual harassment in public spaces and the workplace, rape and sexual assault, hate crime against lesbians, and prostitution. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Violence by the state, across borders and in the global arena &amp;ndash; covering trafficking, rape as a weapon of war, and peacemaking, reconstruction and UN resolution 1325. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each section contains several session plans, which include a detailed case study, some key facts, questions for group discussion and for further thought, learning exercises, and facilitator instructions. There is also a form to evaluate the manual, workshop sessions and the facilitator, and this is followed by a further reading section on the UN mandate for the elimination of violence against women, and examples from Latin America of tackling violence against women and girls. This is followed by appendices setting out the UN resolutions relevant for this topic, and an annotated bibliography. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Investors are buying up vast tracks of land across the developing world in a modern day ‘land rush’. This analysis by Oxfam explores where land is changing hands and why. It finds that investors appear to be targeting countries with weak governance in order to secure land quickly and cheaply. It is revealed that over three quarters of the 56 countries where land deals were agreed between 2000 and 2011 scored below average on four key governance indicators. Moreover, in countries where national governments are more accountable to their citizens and where rule of law and control of corruption is strong, local people and communities will have a better chance to have their voices and interests represented in land deals. Oxfam urges the World Bank to announce a temporary freeze on its agricultural investments which involve large scale land acquisition so it can review its advice to developing countries, help set standards for investors and introduce more robust policies to stop land-grabs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The consequences of development-induced displacement are the subject of research undertaken by experts from many disciplines. In addition to the specialist theoretical concepts (IRR Model; Colson-Scudder Four Stage Model), and useful general approaches (human rights, sociology, anthropology) an analysis on the basis of human security and development plays an increasingly important role. The classification of seven categories of human security, included in the UNDP Human Development Report, published in 1994, may be a valuable research tool for all specialists dealing with displacement studies. This fact is reflected by the growing scale of publications analysing the intersection of environmental changes, conflict, and displacement (Suhrke, Westing, Myers). At least a few authors (Caspary, Bharali, Ozerdem &amp;amp; Jacoby) pointed out the usefulness of the concept of human security in the analysis of development-induced displacement and resettlement. Despite a stagnation of research in human security, observed in recent years, its application in the research of very dynamic global problems (such as famine and displacement) is still worthy of consideration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of this article is to consider the application of the most influential human security concepts to DIDR research. Taking into account the most influential human security classifications, the author tries to analyse the major problems facing displaced people. This analysis helps to determine what actions can help to improve the situation of displaced persons and to minimise the risks that affect them. Its connection to established models of analysis (IRR) can be helpful in specific development decisions in avoiding the problems typical for previous resettlement. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article outlines a panel session organised by Development Alternatives with Women of a New Era (DAWN) at the People&amp;rsquo;s Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The panel, moderated by Gita Sen, focused on looking beyond poverty to environmental and social justice and a development in which everyone can participate. Speakers included Alex Garrita from Mexico, who drew parallels between Rio +20 and the UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994, alerting the audience to the push to control women&amp;rsquo;s fertility. She thought the main challenge of Rio +20 was to ensure women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights were in place before the move to the post MDG process. Another speaker Nicole Bidegain saw three options for post-2015: the extension or reformulation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) or the introduction of a new framework. She proposed that feminists should be advocating for a new framework which is not minimalistic or donor driven, but instead holistic, including human rights, equity, sexual orientation and gender identity, and the care economy. She added any post-2015 agenda must address issues of financing and the reform of global economic and financial governance as little can be achieved without this. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report on the status of ICT integration in education in Southeast Asia is based on the results of this survey and presents a holistic picture of the status of ICT integration in education in the 11 SEAMEO Member Countries: namely Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Vietnam. The report identifi es strengths and examines how each country integrates ICT in their educational system. Moreover, the report contains best practices and lessons learnt which can serve as a reference in policy formulation, development, and implementation of activities related to integrating ICT in teaching and learning, and even in administrative-related matters. Particularly, in the last chapter, the report provides a summary of SEAMEO Regional Centres’ strengths and initiatives on ICT integration in education and the capacity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Aid for Trade has emerged as an important vehicle for assisting developing countries to improve their trade capacity and to benefit from the expansion of global markets. But any optimism on the volume of Aid for Trade flows is punctuated by the ongoing global economic crisis, which is likely to have important implications for trade and development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This working paper seeks to assess the impact of Aid for Trade thus far, and what has worked and what the barriers to improving the impact of Aid for Trade are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors argue that&amp;nbsp; Aid for Trade works best when:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; it is targeted at reducing the cost of trading, for example through investment in infrastructure, improving trade facilitation and strengthening value chains. These should be driven and guided by support to the capacity of institutions that devise trade policies and regulations. Experience shows that investment in infrastructure, trade facilitation and the strengthening of value chains is most effective when it is integrated into and driven by a country&amp;rsquo;s broader trade policy and strategy &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; it addresses the binding constraint to growth. This will be largely country-specific and, according to traditional growth diagnostics, can relate to factors that affect the availability of finance of an investment project or factors (e.g. infrastructure, skills, transport costs) that affect returns to an investment &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; there is effective coordination between donors and recipients around the design, implementation and monitoring of the Aid for Trade programmes, as well as coordination among different donors, within donor agencies themselves (e.g. between country offices and headquarters), between different ministries within a recipient country government and between recipient governments and their regional trading partners &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; the selection of instruments and modalities for delivering Aid for Trade are able to address trade-related constraints at the transnational and regional level. Many Aid for Trade projects are targeted towards improving trade for individual countries, when in fact greater gains can be made by focusing on ensuring greater integration of trade within regions &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; the M&amp;amp;E of impacts, outcomes and outputs is realistic (the achievement of objectives can be traced along a feasible results chain), based on the collection of baseline data, and lessons contribute to the design of future projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report focuses on the community as the central point of measuring vulnerability to climate change in Choiseul Province of the Solomon Islands. It discusses the factors that affect people’s resilience to the impacts of climate change at the community level. Given the close connectivity of livelihoods and natural resources in the region, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches are deemed an appropriate adaptation response in Choiseul Province. The report recommends a number of adaptation options addressing land, coastal, community and sea-based vulnerabilities. It underlines that, in order to develop an effective adaptation response, a multi-sectoral and multi-partner approach is required to adequately address the complexity of factors contributing to the people of Choiseul’s vulnerability and capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This is a draft working paper on sexual and reproductive health and rights in the context of the post-2015 framework. Universal health insurance is a critical factor in achieving health coverage because of the role it can play in providing financial protection against expensive health costs. Equally the design of health insurance schemes can have major implications for women and girls as it can either facilitate or impede access to sexual and reproductive health services. For example compulsory social insurance schemes that are linked to formal employment may exclude from coverage large proportions of women who work in the informal sector, or do not participate in waged employment. On the other hand, social protection health insurance schemes that target poor and marginalised women with no-fee services or conditional cash transfers may facilitate access to services as well as simultaneously incentivising health-seeking behaviour. The post-2015 development framework should also focus on impediments to receiving sexual and reproductive rights and health, such as social and cultural norms and encourage specific associated programmes. Suggestions include addressing the deprioritisation of immunisations for girls in countries where son preference is prevalent, or stigma and discrimination against unmarried women seeking sexual health services in health facilities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report seeks to better understand the relationships between biodiversity, carbon, forests and people, so as to support the achievement of REDD+ objectives. It summarises the latest scientific literature to make sense of the complex web of relationships, how they may be affected by the implementation of REDD+ management activities, and the potential trade-offs and synergies between and among environmental and socioeconomic objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introduction provides a summary of the issue, presenting contextual data to illustrate the importance of, and challenges faced by, forest ecosystems. It also discusses REDD+ and its aims of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as conserving, managing and increasing forests as carbon stocks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report is split into four chapters. The first chapter explores the relationships and impacts of deforestation and forest degradation on biodiversity, carbon and other ecosystem services. Covering a range of forest types, it gives a broad overview of biodiversity and carbon relationships in potential REDD+ programme regions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impacts of forest and land management on biodiversity and carbon are the focus of the second chapter, which explores management and action approaches, identifying areas for improving agricultural practice, measures to reduce the impact of various extractive industries, and indicators for the effective monitoring of carbon and biodiversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social and economic considerations relevant to REDD+ are covered by the third chapter, including the social and economic context of governance and its consequences. This chapter concludes that REDD+ activities can greatly benefit poor people (particularly through participatory practices) and generate significant financial flows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth chapter examines existing and future options for governance of REDD+, forest management and biodiversity. It explores options to synergise climate, forest management and biodiversity at both the national and international scale, including information on data collection, planning, policies and finance. The report concludes that governance is likely to remain pluralistic; rather than impose a singular solution, this complexity should be embraced. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study tries to present the socio-economic scenario of child labour in Bangladesh which has in recent times attracted concerted attention not only in Bangladesh but also all over the globe. Indeed, child labour is recognised as a considerable part of the existing labour market and by the present write-up this statement has been upheld through a number of case studies. There is no question as regards the indispensability of elimination of child labour from the society but question arises whether it would bring good for any particular society (such as Bangladesh). Child labour problem is a socio-economic reality in the country which can’t be ignored. Hence steps have to be taken at first to decrease child labour gradually rather removing it diametrically from the society. It should be remembered that if child labour is driven out just now from the country, then that would jeopardize the child labourers who earn their own bread or for the families who depend on the child workers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>When a family breaks up, it is usually difficult for everyone in the family to cope with the situation; however, children are often the worst victims of family breakup. There are powerful reasons to be alarmed about the impacts of family breakup on children. They feel insecure, depressed and helpless when they see their family break apart. The present study aims at identifying the effects of family breakup on children. The purposively chosen research site was the city of Khulna in Bangladesh. Using a survey method, data were collected from seventy children. After analyzing the data collected from the field survey, this report concludes that children of the broken families are particularly vulnerable and they need special care for their mental, psychological and physical development. After presenting the main findings in a descriptive fashion, the article provides a set of recommendations that will support children in the broken families. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mobile phones have emerged as truly pervasive and affordable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform in the last decade. Large penetration of cellular networks and availability of advanced hardware platforms have inspired multiple innovative research opportunities in mobile computing domain. However, most of the research challenges have focused on typical scenarios existing in the developed economies. Using the healthcare as an application for mobile computing, we present research challenges and novelties in mobile computing domain that take account for differences between developing such as India and developed economies based on commonly available mobile platforms, communication cost, differences in user behavior and acceptable societal norms, among others. With localization being
a critical component of various mobile systems, we present early results for the application of GPS-less localization that highlight the corresponding differences in Indian context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In 2010, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and El Colegio de Mexico hosted an expert group meeting in Mexico to discuss aspects of population dynamics with particular focus on adaptation to climate change. Synthesising the emergent themes from this meeting, the groups collaborated to produce this publication, which seeks to plug a knowledge gap in the adaptation field with regard to how population dynamics impacts adaptation planning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors argue that too much of adaptation effort is spent on reacting to events and that we must transition to an anticipatory model which adapts to how things will be rather than how things are now. Population dynamics is a crucial aspect of this, playing a central role in livelihoods, location, economic and environmental vulnerability and resilience, as well as helping to avoid static perceptions of vulnerability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publication is divided into three sections. Section one concerns the key concepts of population dynamics and adaptation. It discusses incorporating population dynamics in climate change adaptation policy and practice, tapping synergies and avoiding exclusionary policies with regard to urbanisation, and on migration as a response to local and global transformations. On this last topic, the author proposes a typology of mobility, accounting for the interrelations between climate change and socioeconomic and cultural transformations and highlighting the diversity of migration and its drivers. The second section discusses the sources and methodologies of population data for adaptation, mapping a path to incorporating such data into adaptation analysis and programming. Finally, the third section covers the planning and practice of adaptation. Firstly, a case study is presented on the local vulnerability and adaptive capacity in five urban areas of Malawi; mapped census data shows high variation in adaptive capacities of households and communities, with comparable vulnerabilities to rural communities. The final two chapters consider the challenges of adaptation in an early but unassisted urban transition, and planning for adaptation in a megacity (using the Mexico City metropolitan area as a case study). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Rabies is a major health problem in Bangladesh. The data indicates that the epidemiological characteristics of the disease are not much different from other studies and have not changed much over the decades. Hence, there are need to educate the community and health workers about the importance of immediate and adequate post-exposure treatment, to start effective control programme for dog and to make availability of TCV as well as RIG. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Toolkit is a comprehensive, practical guide that all governments, their ministries, departments and agencies can adapt to suit their own circumstances and their own vision and goals. Its publication is very timely. This is a period when all health systems face stringent economic challenges, greater demands for efficiencies and higher expectations from citizens. There is, everywhere, an urgent challenge to provide more care and better care to more people, especially those most in need.
This Toolkit expertly demonstrates how all nations can rise to that challenge, each in its own way. While it brings the sectors of health and ICT much closer together, the Toolkit also encourages the active participation of a wider range of stakeholders, including the general public, reflecting important issues of social justice and equity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Cash transfers to households are becoming an increasingly common policy instrument for reducing poverty, particularly in some countries of sub-Saharan Africa. However pilot schemes are not always modelled at their design stage to estimate whether the cash transfers would have an affordable impact on poverty if scaled up. This briefing note explains how to overcome this problem by using a simple microsimulation tool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool uses household survey data to predict the costs and poverty outcomes of cash transfer programmes under different scenarios before any programme is launched. It can also simulate how the benefit will be distributed among households with different consumption levels or different household composition &amp;ndash; something that is not possible with tools that use macro-level data such as national population data. The briefing note explains the key steps needed to use the tool and the issues that should be considered along the way. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Buddha is a great benefactor of humanity. After the attainment of the Enlightenment in Bodhgaya and preaching First Sermon in Sarnath, the Buddha founded the order of Monks (Bhikkhusangha). This order of Monks increased and within forty five years of Buddhaâ€™s ministry it had spread throughout ancient India. But groundless belief of Brahmins is that woman is inferior to man. The position which the woman lost under the dominance of the Brahmins of the day evidently showed little sympathy for her. In this article I will explore the position of women considering their spiritual and cultural activities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study examines, applying future climate local scenarios, climate change impacts in northern Honduras and makes recommendations to strengthen the resilience of the International Fund for Agricultural Development&amp;rsquo;s (IFAD) &amp;lsquo;Northern Horizons&amp;rsquo; project beneficiaries in the coffee, cocoa, maize and bean value chains. The analysis was prepared jointly by the Fundaci&amp;oacute;n para la Investigaci&amp;oacute;n del Clima (FIC, Climate Research Foundation) and the Instituto de Estudios del Hambre (IEH, Institute of Hunger Studies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Expected impacts for the coffee crop are negative due to the increase in temperatures that will provoke changes in the crop cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the maize crop, the future climate will be beneficial to most of the studied areas, though in some areas higher rainfall will complicate certain farming phases. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For beans, increased rainfall will make sowing, flowering and grain filling more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Recommendations include improving the existing varieties and crop management, diversification of cocoa grower income sources with timber species, supporting investment in infrastructure such as irrigation systems or drying facilities, encouraging more efficient associations, supporting small scale-scale producers and doing research on the relationships between crop and climate. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Greening rural development can stimulate rural economies, create jobs and help maintain critical ecosystem services and strengthen climate resilience of the rural poor. This report by the Ministry of Rural Development, India, with support from the United Nations Development Programme, presents strategies for inclusive rural development embodying the principles of environmental sustainability. It defines ‘green’ outcomes for major rural development schemes, reviews the design and evidence from the field to highlight potential green results and recommends steps to improve green results. The rationale for greening rural development emerges from India’s Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) strategy of faster, sustainable and inclusive growth for poverty alleviation and the Ministry of Rural Development’s mandate to reduce rural poverty and ensure a better quality of life especially for the poor. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study discusses the issue of digital divide is often discussed in terms of the outreach of information technology and communication infrastructure that provides electronic connectivity. Although availability of adequate bandwidth and reasonable access to internet are key factors in bridging the digital divide, these alone are not sufficient for providing benefits of e-governance to the common people, particularly the poor in developing countries. The relevance and usefulness of content to meet the local needs of people are very important in making a creative use of technology to bridge the digital divide for achieving the developmental goals. Not only this, a conscious effort to enmesh the basic principles of good governance in information technology related initiatives is also necessary to ensure that the poor and the vulnerable are able to easily access the services that the government provides to them. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This book chapter from 'Climate change - realities, impacts over ice cap, sea level and risks' (ed. Singh, B. R.) argues that although many institutions across sub-Saharan Africa are engaged in initiatives targeted towards adapting rainfed agriculture to climate change, this also presents complex research and policy challenges. Given the generally low impact of agricultural research across the region on improving the welfare of rainfed farmers, a comprehensive strategy is required if the considerably more complex challenge of adapting agriculture to future climate change is to successful. The chapter provides a brief assessment of the complexities and challenges and describes the research approach to address these challenges. The authors conclude that to ensure that African researches have strong research capabilities, there needs to be investments in: ways to improve access to information; ways to enhance research capacity; and ways to enhance the impact of the research undertaken. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The positive trend observed in recent accelerated economic growth in sub-saharan African countries represents a huge opportunity to foster sustainable development, This paper contributes to the literature by providing a more accurate and nuanced view on the progress made with regards to child malnutrition and inequalities across sub-saharan Africa. It focuses on seven countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Cameroon Ghana and Nigeria. The study analyses the evolution of three anthropometric indicators such as underweight, stunting and wasting and elaborates a classification of countries based on how inequalities in child malnutrition have changed over the past two decades. Findings shows that countries that have registered the highest improvements in overall malnutrition rates are not proportionate to the pace of economic growth &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This book examines the food security threats facing 11 west African countries — Benin, Burkina Faso, C&amp;ocirc;te d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo — and explores how climate change will increase the efforts needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the region. Through the use of hundreds of scenario maps, models, figures and detailed analysis, the publication presents plausible future scenarios that combine economic and biophysical characteristics to explore the possible consequences for agriculture, food security and resources management to 2050. It also offers recommendations to national governments and regional economic agencies already dealing with the vulnerabilities of climate change and deviations in environment. The book is aimed as a tool for decision-makers and researchers to aid the shaping policy and study of the various and likely consequences of climate change. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Farmers and herders in arid regions of Africa are highly exposed to climate stresses, especially drought. However, adaptation to climate change is not only a biophysical or technical problem, it also involves social challenge. Although communities in semi-arid zones have organised their livelihoods around uncertainty, climate predictions indicate that new extremes will be a real challenge to their capacity to adapt. This report looks at local social institutions in Ethiopia and Mali and their role in adaptation. It finds that these institutions mediate people’s adaptive processes, production practices, land and water governance, social support systems, gendered household dynamics, use of weather and climate information, and interactions with external actors and interventions. Adaptation is a long-term transformation and efforts that build on or complement existing adaptive processes and institutions stand a better chance of being both materially and socially effective. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Micronesia has the highest per capita net emigration rate in the world. This paper provides an overview of the Micronesian migration experience, and shows that a range of public policies can shape a country&amp;rsquo;s experience with migration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper presents the following findings:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the exodus of citizens further complicates the region&amp;rsquo;s development challenges, not just in terms of &amp;lsquo;brain drain&amp;rsquo; but also the impacts on population growth and inward migration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;pull factors include potential for improved living standard, safety and security, political and religious freedom, family reunification and return to ethnic homeland&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;all things considered, there is very good reason to believe that the Micronesian exodus will continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, the author argues that governments can do more to balance the outflow of migrants, by investing more in education and growing the local economy at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the primary policy aim should be to develop attractive employment prospects locally, and ensure school leavers are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the demands of a growing local labour market&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investing in quality and fee-free higher education may also provide more options for young people to stay in the region &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, improved options for choice migration not only serve the personal interest but may also contribute to the national interest through more and higher remittances &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;furthermore, developing and maintaining links with the population living overseas would enable local governments, business and institutions to draw on the expertise of the diaspora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In the final analysis, the document states that there is no need to apply artificial brakes on migration. Integrating education, employment and migration policies can grow the domestic labour force, and ensure individuals can migrate with better skills thus opening more opportunities in overseas labour markets. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper reveals that maternal and child health (MCH) services coverage in Pakistan is poor, and overall use of these services is low compared to other countries in the region. The paper illustrates that the low rates of utilisation are driven by a low sensitivity and recognition of illness symptoms. Furthermore, the paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;overall healthcare use is not unequal, but poor Pakistanis are certainly sicker, so there is considerable inequity in use of services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;when healthcare is obtained, private providers are the dominant source of treatment, with government healthcare services only accounting for one-fifth of utilisation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the main reasons for not using government facilities are lack of access and distance to government facilities, followed by lack or inadequate supply of medicines&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, it is likely that use of MCH services in Pakistan frequently impoverishes families and acts as a disincentive to greater use of medical services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author concludes that both lack of physical access to nearby healthcare facilities and the financial costs of treatment need to be addressed to improve utilisation of MCH services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to increase access to services, Pakistan needs to increase public financing and risk pooling in an effective manner to reduce the financial burdens faced by households&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the priority should be to expand the facility network in rural areas and to improve the supply of medicines within the government system&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, increasing health awareness and changing health behaviours would be a key part of improving overall health outcomes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report, the first annual Mobile Southeast Asia report addresses the growing strength of mobile innovation practices in the region. The material is drawn from interviews with over two dozen digital media experts and organisers
of the MobileMonday chapters in the six key regional markets, as well as extensive research from books, journals, news, and market reports. The focus of the report is on the overall innovation ecosystem, which includes a range of stakeholders: industry, entrepreneurs, government, academia and civil society. The report also addresses the crucial role of innovator networks and incubators, who truly make Southeast Asia a regional and global crossroads of
innovation. Sustainability of the innovation ecosystem requires the right blend of bottom up entrepreneurial energy and top-down facilitation of investment policies and infrastructure. These roles are played by global+local networks of mobile startups and professionals. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the Amacayacu National Park in Colombia, which partially overlaps with Indigenous territories, several elements of an inclusive protected area management model have been implemented since the 1990s. In particular, a dialogue between scientific researchers, indigenous people and park staff has been promoted for the co-production of biological and cultural knowledge for decision-making. This paper, based on a four-year ethnographic study of the park, shows how knowledge products about different components of the socio-ecosystem neither were efficiently obtained nor were of much importance in park management activities. Rather, the knowledge pertinent to park staff in planning and management is the know-how required for the maintenance and mobilization of multi-scale social-ecological networks. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Major development projects involving infrastructure or extractive industries - both in Latin America and other regions - tend to be financed, either partially or totally, by international financial institutions (IFIs). Given that these types of large-scale projects could have adverse effects on local communities’ livelihoods, cultural heritage and environment, IFIs have established mechanisms to guarantee that the projects they fund meet international environmental and social standards. Using a successful case from Mexico, this Brief reflects on the role of informed citizen participation as a crucial factor facilitating accountability within development projects with international funding. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Land issues have been rising up the agenda of policy makers due to rapid urbanisation and high food prices. Yet, land administration is one of the most corrupt government activities. How should international donors respond? The first priority is to support domestic governments in improving land administration and anti-corruption processes in general. In addition, donors should undertake explicit analysis of the political economy of land, reduce the impact of their own projects on land administration corruption, help increase transparency and exploit international connections. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The production of crops is an important economic activity for farmers, crop income, nutrition and economic transformation in developing countries. To facilitate better understanding of the synthetic parameters influencing supply response, this study uses annual data of Bangladesh covering 42 years to estimate a classic translog model providing area responses of rice, wheat, cotton, maize, sugarcane and rapeseed to changes in their gross product per hectare. The coefficients of each crop’s equation in the system are estimated with the Full Information Maximum Likelihood method. The own and cross gross product elasticities for each
crop are calculated showing important results. The crop area of the major crop (rice) is weakly gross product responsive as compared with the minor crops. Appropriate policy reforms could help the producers to respond more to price changes as well as to raise levels of average productivity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of the paper is to review some previous researches examining ICT efficiency and the impact of ICT on educational output/outcome as well as different conceptual and methodological issues related to performance measurement. Moreover, a definition, measurements and the empirical application of a model measuring the efficiency of ICT use and its impact at national levels will be considered. For this purpose, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is presented and then applied to selected EU-27 and OECD countries. The empirical results show that the efficiency of ICT, when taking educational outputs/outcomes into consideration, differs significantly across the great majority of EU and OECD countries. The analysis of the varying levels of (output-oriented) efficiency (under the VRSTE framework) shows that Finland, Norway, Belgium and Korea are the most efficient countries in terms of their ICT sectors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Establishing the relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables is very important for formulating current economic stabilisation policies. This paper investigates the causal relationship between four macroeconomic variables and Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) stock prices using cointegration and Granger causality test. The results suggest that cointegration exists between stock prices with each of the variables: M1, M2
and inflation rate, indicating a long-run relationship exists between them. We find evidence that unidirectional causality exists from stock market to exchange rate and M1 in the short run. From bivariate Error-Correction models we also find that long run causality exists from M1, M2 to stock market and from stock market to inflation rate. These results are further strengthened when we expand the analysis for multivariate settings. Here,
we also note some evidence that M2 Granger-cause stock price and the three macroeconomic variables. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>ICT can reduce poverty by improving poor people’s access to education, health, government and financial services. ICT can
also help small farmers and artisans by connecting them to markets. It is clear that in rural India -as well as in much of the developing world- realization of this potential is not guaranteed. This paper outlines a simple model to explain why a digital divide may exist between rich and poor. Low-cost access to information infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for the successful use of ICT by the poor, but it is not sufficient. The implementation of ICT projects needs to be performed by organizations and individuals who have the appropriate incentives to work with marginalized groups. Furthermore, grassroots intermediaries and the involvement of the community are identified as the key factors that foster local ownership and the availability of content and services that respond to the most pressing needs of the poor. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper focuses mainly on issues concerning E-Learning method from user point of view its satisfaction and prediction, problems and prospects. In today’s world many new technologies are evolving like radio, computers, audio cassettes etc. These techniques are very useful and can be embedded in the field of education. ELearning perspective has changed the education Environment and learner’s Mind totally. Most of the foreign institutions are providing these facilities. In India rural communities have realized the importance of education. But in some rural areas, teaching relieves and availability of basic equipment for educational tasks is minimal. Imaginative teaching methods are needed in school to stimulate learning motivation. Nowadays, the two popular ways that are used for Education in ICT are Distance Learning and E-learning. Distance learning is a dignified teaching and learning system which is carried out remotely with the help of Electronic Communication. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Objective:The 6 month assessment of the response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical step. In sub-Saharan Africa, few people have access to plasma viral-load measurement. The gain or loss in body mass index (BMI) was assessed alone or in combination with corresponding gain in CD4 cells as a tool for predicting the response to ART. Methods: In a cohort of 622 adults in Abidjan, C&amp;ocirc;te d’Ivoire, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of BMI and CD4 for treatment success defined as viral-load undetectability (&amp;lt; 300 copies/ml) as gold standard. Conclusion In settings where viral-load measurement is not available, a high BMI gain does not reflect virological success, even when combined with a high CD4 gain. In our population, most patients with detectable viral-load had probably adhered to the drug regimen sufficiently to reach significant gains in body mass and CD4 count but had adhered insufficiently to reach viral suppression. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Trade and investment reforms in the Laos since the mid-1980s have boosted natural resource-based exports, underpinning recent economic growth. This paper examines how the Lao export-led growth can be channeled into directions that deliver the greatest benefit to the Lao people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper states that the effect of the economic growth on people depends on how the government uses these revenues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a high proportion of the proceeds from Lao boosted exports accrue directly to the national government &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;almost all of the resource revenues are currently being absorbed into the domestic economy &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;identically, the level of foreign exchange reserves, as a proportion of GDP has not increased &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions encompass:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;domestic absorption of Lao revenues earned from natural resource-based exports undermines the competitiveness of traditional traded goods industries &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expanded spending should be focused on rural spending, and on social services such as education and health &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;furthermore, the government is recommended to assist those people who are affected negatively, enabling them to find productive opportunities in other sectors of the economy &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, a policy of gradual absorption of the resource revenues is desirable for Laos under its current circumstances &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;indeed, slowing the rate of absorption give the Lao public service more time to plan how to spend the revenues wisely, while rapid absorption is seriously risky &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;nevertheless, the optimal rate of absorption of the proceeds of the export boom depends on the rate at which the revenues can be absorbed productively &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author also makes a point that retraining and adjustment assistance is required rather than protectionism in responding to the adverse impacts of current model of absorption. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Uganda has been regarded as a development success story due to its increasing economic growth and declining poverty. Nevertheless, the country’s economic dependence on agriculture makes it very sensitive to climate variability and change. Temperatures in Uganda have been steadily increasing and climate hazards such as floods and droughts have become more frequent and intense, a trend expected to continue. Ugandan smallholder farmers already know and apply various global best practices to reduce climate risks, but much remains to be done to improve these local responses. This report argues that adopting, for example, small-scale irrigation, conservation agriculture measures and intercropping techniques could contribute to offsetting the negative impacts of climate change. Moreover, combining local and scientific knowledge for improved local weather forecasts, early warning systems and the optimum use of agroforestry could also provide innovative and practical solutions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Traditional forage conservation, locally known as â€œngitiliâ€, which involves retaining an area of standing vegetation from the beginning of rainy season and opening it up for grazing at the peak of dry season, has become an important strategy for rangeland rehabilitation in the north-western semi-arid part of Tanzania. The present study assessed the current rangeland management practices, the role of indigenous knowledge on ngitili conservation and perceptions of agropastoralists on communal resources management. Data were collected from a total of 10 villages of Shinyanga rural and Meatu district. Interviewed agro-pastoralists claimed that, unequal sharing of benefits accrued from communal resources and poor management of communal ngitili lead to the preference of private ngitili to communal ones. The contribution of indigenous knowledge of Sukuma people lead to the success of ngitili conservation. However, the sustainability of this vital local knowledge is questionable. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Review of literature shows that intervention of information and communication technologies (ICT) in rural development initiatives are capable of development, but are not successful. Lack of community participation, absence of an integrated approach and non-inclusion of traditional knowledge systems (TKS) in the project designs are the major impediments. We therefore suggest a systems-based approach in the design of e-Governance projects, and brief some future directions. The proposed framework is based on participatory approach with inclusion of relevant TKS, has a bi-directional Citizen to Government (G2C2G) interface and a feedback mechanism. The prime goal is that rural e-Governance projects serve as means to attain good-governance for enhancing sustained rural development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The regional context presents an unprecedented opportunity for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to close the infrastructure gap in water supply and sanitation services over the next 20 years. However, an important part of LAC urban population is still without service or with substandard services, where most cities have significant deficiencies in terms of infrastructure for rainwater drainage, and protection of water sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document shows that LAC needs to make a commitment to a strategy for the integrated development of water to deal with large imbalances between demand and availability of water and reverse environmental degradation. In addition, the region must deal decisively with the multifaceted challenges of high vulnerability to natural disasters and long term impacts of climate variability and change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to achieve the development goals of the water sector in the LAC region, governments must take decisions on policies, institutions and investments at various levels which generally go beyond the mandate of water management &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;commitments are particularly needed from planning and finance ministries, legislative bodies, and local governments, with the effective participation of civil society &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the region should reverse the low rates of investment in social infrastructure as a means of delivering quality services for all, while properly maintaining the water assets developed in recent decades through sustained efforts of rehabilitation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author argues that a sectoral governance framework that guarantees efficient service provision is required, and meeting the demand for services of the most disadvantaged segments of the population should be the target for LAC governments. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Countries in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region generally lack policies, strategies and plans which deal specifically with flash floods. The purpose of the case studies in this report is to create a knowledge base on flash flood processes in different parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The report examines the region’s diverse climatic and socioeconomic conditions in order to understand existing flash flood risk management mechanisms, including policies and institutional mechanisms, and increase awareness about flash floods. The eight case studies were conducted in Xichang and Niujuangou in Sichuan, China; Dhemaji District in Assam, India; the Bhote Koshi/Sun Koshi basin (two case studies), Lal Bakaiya and Madi in Nepal; and Chitral District in Pakistan. This report contains a summary of each case study, as well as an overview of the status of flash flood risk management in the region and a list of regional recommendations for policymakers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Focusing on the climate problem, it is now clear that developing countries, especially fast-growing regions such as those in the so-called BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China), will have a major impact on future emission dynamics and will play a major role in climate negotiations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper builds on the assumption that OECD countries are (or will soon be) taking actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These actions, however, will not be sufficient to control global warming, unless developing countries also get involved in the cooperative effort to reduce GHG emissions. This paper investigates the best short-term strategies that emerging economies can adopt in reacting to OECD countries&amp;rsquo; mitigation effort, given the common long-term goal to prevent excessive warming without hampering economic growth. Results indicate that developing countries would incur substantial economic losses by following a myopic strategy that disregards climate in the short-run, and that their optimal investment behaviour is to anticipate the implementation of a climate policy by roughly 10 years. Investing in innovation ahead of time is also found to be advantageous. The degree of policy anticipation is shown to be important in determining the financial transfers of an international carbon market meant to provide incentives for the participation of developing countries. This is especially relevant for China, whose recent and foreseeable trends of investments in innovation are consistent with the adoption of domestic emission reduction obligations in 2030. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Situational Analysis reveals that the government and the MoEVT recognize the potential of ICT to act as a tool for improving education delivery, outcomes and impact, as evidenced through the national plans, policies and strategies. The Tanzania Vision 2025, the key national development strategy, recognizes the role of education as a strategic change agent for transformation of the economy to a knowledge economy, and identifies the potential of ICT to address most of the development challenges including those presented by education. The National ICT Policy of 2003 recognizes that ICT can enhance education opportunities and advocates for the introduction of an e-education system. The Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) recognizes the role of computer studies in fostering technological and scientific developments, with the education sector review reiterating the need to expand the use of ICT to improve on the quality of education. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The concept of gender equality is a common concern all over the World. The same has now acquired new dimensions with the advent of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The ICT has a potential to bring development for a nation. It can reduce trade distortions, eliminate poverty, empower weaker segments including women, etc. The same is, however, possible only if a nation follows sound ICT strategies and policies. We have to set our priorities to those areas where we are lagging far behind. One such area is the unequal access of ICT to women. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Aid for Trade (AfT) has emerged as an important vehicle to help the private sector in developing countries to improve its trade capacity and to benefit from the expansion of global markets, which would allow for economic growth and job creation, and help developing countries to move from reliance on aid to the use of trade to generate higher standards of living. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Briefing Paper draws on a review that suggests AfT is subject to the same failures of collective action that affect aid in many other sectors. It discusses the success criteria that help to determine the effectiveness of AfT barriers and opportunities, design and implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It concludes with the following suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; demand for specific AfT projects must be driven by the recipient country, and AfT must address barriers to trade in a measurable way&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; improving understanding of the nature and causes of coordination failures and information asymmetries specific to the political economy of recipient countries and regions, as well as donor agencies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; given that trade is, by definition, cross-border, there is a strong economic rationale to strengthen regional institutions as well as for more investment in trans-national corridor approaches&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; investing in the collection of baseline data and providing measurable outcomes (e.g. port clearance time; trade volumes) would help to address concerns about attribution&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>South Asian countries have witnessed significant shift in the structure of their economy during the last few decades, in terms of the dominance of the services sector compared to the traditional sectors such as agriculture and industry. The contribution of the services trade in total trade of South Asian countries is increasing over time. Recognising the importance, South Asian countries have embarked on extending regional economic cooperation beyond the free trade agreement on goods (South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)), to services. The draft South Asian Framework Agreement on Services (SAFAS) has been adopted with this end in view. It is expected that intra-regional trade and investment in health services will take place through operationalisation of the SAFAS. This will, in turn, help to improve the quality of healthcare within the region. 
Bangladesh, like other South Asian countries, is yet to ensure improved healthcare for all its citizens. Due to inadequate facility and lack o &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Male partner involvement in maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) care has been around for a long time but nothing has been done since nobody has figured out how to do it on a large scale. We assessed men’s knowledge and their awareness of their wives’ actual practices regarding MNCH care issues. The study was conducted in four ‘improving maternal, neonatal and child survival’ (IMNCS) intervention districts (Nilphamari, Rangpur, Gaibandha and Mymensingh) of BRAC and two control districts (Naogaon and Netrokona) during October 2008-January 2009. Data were collected from 7,200 men whose wives had experienced a pregnancy outcome in the preceding year of the survey or who had live child aged 12-59 months. Chi-squared tests and t-tests were performed for comparing grouped districts and Cohen’s Kappa was used to assess the level of agreement between men and women regarding MNCH practices and decision-making. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Local Faith Communities (LFCs) are groupings of religious actors bonded through shared allegiance to institutions, beliefs, history or identity. They engage in a range of activities across the humanitarian spectrum. Resilience – defined as the ability to anticipate, withstand and bounce back from external pressures and shocks – is increasingly a central construct in the shaping of humanitarian strategy by the international community. Faith groups are often central to strengthening resilience and reinforcing the local processes of identity and connection that comprise the social fabric of communities disrupted by disaster or conflict. There is increasing recognition of LFCs’ roles by the mainstream humanitarian community, as evidenced by emerging research and international dialogues on faith, such as the UNHCR Dialogue on Faith and Protection in December 2012. However there are a number of challenges to establishing partnerships with LFCs. This Joint Learning Initiative (JLI) on Faith and Local Communities is seeking to understand the role of LFCs in strengthening resilience, and to address three challenges to full engagement with LFCs: a lack of evidence regarding the impact of LFCs on individual and community resilience; a lack of trust, knowledge and capacity for such engagement; and the need for clear, implementable actions to improve partnership and the effectiveness of humanitarian response. This scoping document investigates the evidence for LFC contribution to resilience under the guidance of the JLI Resilience Learning Hub, membership of which is made up of 20 practitioners, academics and policymakers expert in humanitarian services and faith communities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a brief review of the technologies, the rural ICT projects and the issues associated with the use of ICT for rural e-Governance applications. Rural e-Governance applications in the recent past have demonstrated the important role the ICT play in the realm of rural development. Several e-Governance projects have attempted to improve the reach, enhance the base, minimize the processing costs, increase transparency, and reduce the cycle times. Several states have initiated the creation of State Wide Area Networks (SWAN) to facilitate electronic access of the state and district administration services to the citizens in villages. Although significant efforts are required to design, develop and internalize the ICT solutions through well managed reengineering of back-end processes and capacity building efforts to ensure sustainability. Suitable publicprivate partnership models have to be adopted to ensure rapid development and costeffective solutions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article highlights the need for initiating a healthcare business model in a grassroots, emerging-nation context. This article’s backdrop is a history of chronic anomalies afflicting the healthcare sector in India and similarly placed BRICS nations. In these countries, a significant percentage of populations remain deprived of basic healthcare facilities and emergency services. Community (primary care) services are being offered by public and private stakeholders as a panacea to the problem. Yet, there is an urgent need for specialized (tertiary care) services at all levels. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As the impacts of global forces on everyday life are becoming increasingly apparent, the authors of this introductory chapter to an edited volume ask: if we believe in the ideals of democracy, what are the implications when these extend beyond traditionally understood national and local boundaries? If we are interested in the possibilities of citizen action to claim and ensure rights, and to bring about social change, how do citizens navigate this new, more complicated terrain? Research in the volume is introduced, in which this theme is explored through empirical research in Brazil, India, the Gambia, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa, as well as in cross-national projects in Latin America and Africa. The case studies focus on a number of sectors: the environment, trade, education, livelihoods, health and HIV/AIDS, work and occupational disease, agriculture and land. Taking a citizen&amp;rsquo;s perspective, they look upwards and outwards at shifting global forms of authority and ask whether, in response to these governance changes, citizens themselves are expressing new rights claims on global duty holders, and whether they are expressing new forms of global solidarity with citizens in other localities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introductory chapter to book: Globalizing Citizens: New Dynamics of Inclusion and Exclusion. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is a positional paper that is set to take inventory of existing innovative ICT solutions in health service delivery (e-health) in rural community of developing countries and to open up researches into the acceptability and utilization of various ICT solutions in health services in developing countries. The assessment is based on the existing e-health model of Peter Dury (2005) and other subsequent works of other Authors who have researched into electronic health solutions in developing countries.
The 5Cs model as refered to by Dury 92005) was used as a framework for assessment, from this model; checklist was developed for assessing the eHealth solutions in rural communities in developing countries of Sub-saharan Africa to measure innovation, accessibility and sustainability. Further research is set to examine the role of an innovative information system and also factors within the five components that are needed to be considered to have a successful implementation of eHealth &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper showcases that the ICT4D 2.0 focuses on reframing the poor. Where ICT4D 1.0 marginalized them, allowing a supply-driven focus, ICT4D 2.0 centralizes them, creating a demand-driven focus. Where ICT4D 1.0—fortified by the “bottom of the pyramid” concept—characterized the poor largely as passive consumers, ICT4D 2.0 sees them as active producers and innovators. Three overarching challenges thus frame this next development phase: giving the poor the tools to produce digital content and services, offering them incentives that create new incomes and jobs through ICT, and convincing established interests to recognize the scale and value of the ICT-based innovations the poor produce. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores the key reasons behind the movements in the terms of trade and the real net gain and loss from trade in the long run. Like some selected Asian countries (Vietnam, China and South Korea) except India, the terms of trade of Bangladesh has been in falling almost continuously. Bangladesh’s trade performance has improved and gaining momentum despite the TOT deterioration. Bangladesh is also experiencing a net welfare gain from trade due to its increasing market share in terms of export volume and gains in productivity, especially in the dominant garment sector. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme&amp;rsquo;s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (UNDP BCPR), under the Climate Risk Management Technical Assistance Support Project (CRM TASP), this report addresses climate risks and risk management capacity in the health sector in Nicaragua. Building upon the CRM TASP general framework, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) developed a more detailed methodological framework for assessing climate risks and identifying climate risk management options in Nicaragua, as well as in six other Latin American and African countries (Dominican Republic, Honduras, Kenya, Niger, Peru and Uganda). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the poorest country in Central America, Nicaragua faces massive development challenges; for example, Nicaragua&amp;rsquo;s health sector suffers from low expenditures and staff levels, infrastructure shortages and low capacity for dealing with climate-related health impacts. This is one in a series of reports examining climate change adaptation in high-risk countries. According to the report, UNDP views climate change assessments as becoming &amp;lsquo;the lynchpin of national responses and adaptation strategies for many years to come&amp;rsquo; and recommends that this knowledge be combined with &amp;lsquo;real preparedness and action at all country levels&amp;rsquo;. The climate risk assessments discussed in this report feed into a set of country-level projects and regional initiatives that will inform the practice of climate risk management by building an evidence base for understanding how climatic risks are likely to unfold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year in Nicaragua (which has a tropical climate) cyclones, floods and droughts claim dozens of lives and affect tens of thousands of people. According to this report, climate change could increase these impacts. Key recommendations for climate risk management include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;improve water management, flood control and reforestation &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expand and improve health services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;run awareness-raising and education campaigns &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;strengthen community organisations &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;invest in climate and health data monitoring and early warning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;integrate climate risk considerations into health policy documents&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;institutionalise cooperation between health and climate agencies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;strengthen governmental capacities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;establish and implement a comprehensive climate risk management programme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Chondrodysplasia punctata refers to a heterogenous group of conditions which share calcific stippling of cartilage and periarticuler soft tissues. Particularly punctuate calcification is seen in the heel in infancy. These disorders differ in clinical features, severity, inheritance pattern and radiological features. Various types like rhizomelic type (autosomal recessive), X linked dominant type, X linked recessive and Conradi-Hunerman syndrome are found. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Growing pains (GP) is the most common form of episodic childhood musculoskeletal pain1, 2. Medical science is still unable to fully explain the exact causes of the discomfort experienced by up to one â€“third of all children at some time during early childhood.1,2, 3. The Hallmark of growing pain, first it always affects both legs, always gone in morning.3. It is very common and easy to diagnose once the typical clinical characteristics are presented. The natural history is benign with disappearance of most attacks of pain by adolescence. However it is not clear whether some of these children develop symptoms of other noninflammatory pain syndromes 2, 4.In this review described the clinical presentation,pathogenesis, causes, natural course, and alleviating the familyâ€™s anxiety. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this paper is to explore the gender dimensions of e-Health interventions in developing countries. A select number of projects funded by Canada‘s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) are systematically analyzed to draw out good practices in integrating gender analysis in e-Health research projects. We conclude by summarizing the good practices and applying them to analyze new projects to ensure gender is integrated adequately. The paper underscores that e-Health interventions in developing countries need to better articulate the social processes of inequality that affect access and use by men and women. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study applies a modelling approach to predict the potential impact of climate change on waterlogging and salinity distribution with ecohydrology as an option for land management under the projected climate conditions in Huai Khamriam sub-watershed in the northeastern region of Thailand. The areas affected by shallow saline groundwater were found to increase with the simulated climate change scenario. Based on scenario simulation, climate change did not have a substantial impact on salinity distribution, but it had a significant impact to the expansion of waterlogging areas. A management option using ecohydrology simulation approach was performed to reduce the amount of recharge water to groundwater systems. The results indicate that the introduction of fast growing tree species integrated with the shallow groundwater interception in the recharge areas could reduce the expansion of waterlogging and salinised areas under the climate change conditions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change adds pressure on China's water resources, which are already under intense stress. Therefore, the water sector is a top priority in China&amp;rsquo;s national adaptation programme. This policy brief summarises the Adapting to Climate Change in China (ACCC) project's findings on the past and future impacts of climate variability and change on water resources in China, and explores the implications for management and policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key findings include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Uneven rainfall is already causing frequent floods and droughts in China. Therefore, the country must be prepared to shift its water regimes under climate change. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Population growth, urbanisation and industrialisation are increasing demand and polluting water sources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The prevailing pattern of the dry north and wet south seems to persist. This will exacerbate water scarcity in some northern regions, which are particularly important for agriculture.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As China&amp;rsquo;s economy grows and competition for water intensifies, the country will need to develop robust systems for managing its water resources, especially in the water-scarce north. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>When the achievement of women leadership in Science and technology (S&amp;T;) is heighten in developed nations in comparison to women in developing countries, it is unfortunate that women are invariably left below, rarely reaching decision-making positions in S&amp;T; in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Prime Minister and Leader of Opposition are female but when it comes to leadership in science, it is difficult to find a Marie Curie in Bangladesh. Men are twenty times more likely than women to reach the top level positions in research. Women are underrepresented in almost in all scientific boards. The scarcity of women in senior positions in such bodies inevitably means that their opinions are less likely to be voiced in policy and decisionmaking processes, which may lead to bias decision-making and priority setting in scientific research. The causes of lower representation of women in S&amp;T; are discussed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Asia and the Pacific region is gaining increased influence in the world economy but is still grappling to overcome interrelated challenges of poverty and sustainable development. This paper discusses key challenges faced throughout this region, underlying that the region&amp;rsquo;s priorities will be of significant importance in informing the contents of any post-2015 global development framework. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;despite the region&amp;rsquo;s overarching economic progress, it still faces a significant task in ending extreme poverty in its many forms &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, the region will still face deep challenges of relative poverty and inequality, both within and between countries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the interrelated challenges of environmental sustainability are also becoming increasingly serious, and the issues are only on track to grow in consequence&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;indeed, many parts of Asia will still need global support in meeting these challenges&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;at the same time, Asia will increasingly need to identify areas where it contributes to meeting global challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the paper suggests a conceptual Asian-based framework for setting a new generation of global goals. The &amp;ldquo;ZEN&amp;rdquo; framework stands for the following targets:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the distinct challenges of achieving zero extreme poverty (Z)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;setting country-specific &amp;ldquo;epsilon&amp;rdquo; benchmarks for broader development challenges (E)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;promoting environmental sustainability both within and across borders (N)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author highlights that a viable goal of zero extreme poverty, in Asia and around the world, has the potential to inspire people around the world. Moreover, many of the world&amp;rsquo;s most significant challenges lie at the intersection of these E and N goals, thus cross-country coordination will be essential to success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document recommends the adoption of ZEN framework, claiming that a post-2015 global framework will not achieve success unless it helps addressing Asia&amp;rsquo;s challenges directly. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A descriptive type of cross sectional study was conducted on 132 students of class IX and X of Mymensingh sadar upazilla during early April to late June, 2007. This study was performed to assess and compare the level of knowledge and practicing behavior of urban and rural students in regards to hand washing, bathing, tooth brushing and taking care of nail and hair. All the students were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire and observed with an observational check list. The mean age of the students was 14.5Â±0.94 years. The knowledge of the students regarding tube well water for drinking was significantly higher in rural area (98.3%) compared to urban area. In addition, tube well water was stated as safe for bathing by 77.3% and safe for washing by 80.3% students. Hand washing before meal with soap and water was found almost similar among urban and rural students but hand washing with soap and water after defecation was found significantly better in urban area. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Myanmar. Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic is highly concentrated among people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and the sexual clients of these populations. People who inject drugs exhibited the highest HIV prevalence (21.9 percent) in the most recent serosurveillance, meanwhile MSM exhibited the second highest (7.8 percent). There is growing concern of a large-scale HIV epidemic among MSM amidst mounting evidence of it previously being underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons for delayed progress in the national response to HIV risk among MSM is a highly restrictive legal environment. Sex between men in Myanmar is punishable by a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Although such laws are rarely enforced, they complicate the delivery of effective HIV prevention services to the extent that they prevent community-based organisations (CBOs) from being registered with the state and discourage programme beneficiaries from accessing basic HIV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an unfavourable legal environment, Myanmar has identified MSM as a key target population since the previous National Strategic Plan (NSP) on HIV and AIDS (2006- 2010). It further elaborates that key target populations will be of &amp;lsquo;the utmost priority and will rely on high-intensity, sustained, and focused effective interventions.&amp;rsquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of responding to HIV risk among MSM is compounded by a limited ability to measure progress towards stated objectives. For instance, data on condom and lubricant distribution, sexually transmitted infection (STI) service provision, and reliable resource expenditure data are for the most part unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several community-based organisations, some of which are not officially recognised by the state, are involved in health outreach although little is known of their operations. Other key actors in the response include international NGOs, most notably Population Services International (PSI) who reached over 37,000 MSM in 2011 with HIV prevention services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s most recent NSP (2011-2015), like the previous one, lays out a comprehensive set of targets to be met by actors across several sectors. It simultaneously acknowledges the difficulty of fully implementing the plan with current levels of commitment and overseas assistance. What is certain is that there is crucial progress to be made, especially with regards to the restrictive legal environment, with careful use of planned resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more informationa about priorities for Myanmar reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report contain the detailed plan and outcomes for the regional workshop on Designing e-government for the poor. The Workshop was intended to assist the participants in defining priorities and specific actions for progressing to e-government. The Workshop highlighted the potential of e-government and ICT to improve access for the poor to information and government services, and foster economic growth. Countries were able to share their experiences in the implementation of e-government; and discuss issues, and options for implementation. Some of the topics addressed at this Workshop included: e-government programmes for the poor; re-engineering internal processes of government/public administration; factors critical to the successful implementation of e-government including e-training of government officials; stakeholder participation in e-government projects; building community and government leadership; and security and privacy issues in e-government. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Drawing upon several sources of information and types of analysis, including literature reviews, field visits and rapid participatory assessments, this paper provides a critical assessment of land-related development policies and projects over the past two decades in Central America. Reflections on past land-related development policies and projects in Central America are based on their contributions to growth and poverty reduction. The paper calls for future projects to better integrate poverty reduction and development goals, natural resource management, disaster risk management and climate change into a territorial approach stressing local governance and planning. The paper concludes with six specific recommendations, which can serve as the basis for future discussions on the direction of future development support to countries’ land policies and projects in Central America, as well as other regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s population is beginning to age rapidly.&amp;nbsp; According to UN projections, by 2050 older people will comprise a quarter of Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s total population. Shortly after 2035, persons aged 60 and older will outnumber children under age 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This document is the outcome of a national research on the situation of older people in Myanmar, carried out in 2012. It argues that Myanmar has now a window of opportunity to develop and expand creative approaches to help fill the gaps created by changing family structures, through initiatives by government,&lt;br /&gt;empowered communities and civil society. The predictability of the demographic changes that lie ahead and the extensive information provided by the Survey of Older Persons in Myanmar highlight the importance of a social protection system that embraces the older population, their families and communities. This window of opportunity is limited in time and should not be missed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The case study of Villa Tranquila (VT) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, shows the power of a slum upgrading process centred on a local policy of social inclusion. The intervention was characterised by an integral approach: urban problems were addressed by a participative-collaborative management structure between the local government and VT residents, and rather than only focusing on infrastructure like roads and housing, social issues were also addressed. This case offers an outstanding model for achieving social cohesion, community appropriation and sustainability in slum upgrading, one that could be applied in other regions as well. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The five countries of the BRICS, Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa, are facing some common challenges with regard to ageing of their populations, urbanisation, vulnerability to environmental shocks, increasing labour market fragmentation, growing income disparity, and the need to more fully exploit and leverage information and communications technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In view of these significant trends, the International Social Security Association (ISSA) Secretariat has launched a project on social security developments in the BRICS countries, with special emphasis on the extension of coverage. The overall objective of this project is to promote the implementation of the ISSA strategy for the extension of social security coverage launched at the 2010 World Social Security Forum in Cape Town, and thereby assist ISSA member institutions in the BRICS and other countries in their efforts to extend coverage in both qualitative and quantitative terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The findings of this comparative study are intended to provide an important input into an ISSA series of handbooks on extension of coverage to difficult-to-cover groups. It highlights common barriers to increasing coverage and offers pragmatic and innovative policies and administrative responses to address those barriers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>ICT does not automatically add quality. There is however, growing evidence that ICT application to the core business of education can accelerate and improve learning on a number of fronts. It can also provide the means of gathering, connecting and analysing data about teaching and learning in ways that enable us to more accurately diagnose student need and evaluate programs. To apply ICT in these ways requires changed approaches by educators. This paper looks at the contribution that ICT can make to quality in teaching, learning and evaluation through improvements in cognition, pedagogies, convergence, culture, and data. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper attempts to seek answer to the question why some regions being economically better-off are performing poorly in respect of maternal and child health outcomes compared with those which are otherwise (economically) worse-off than the former. Analysing the data obtained from two purposively selected upazilas (sub-district) in Bangladesh, it also tries to explore the factors responsible for better maternal and child health outcomes. This paper found that the impact of better health service delivery system is much stronger than that of growth and the other factors on health outcomes. It also found that ensuring “accountability” of the health service providers is a key factor to provide better health service
delivery. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper analyses the extent to which gender differences are taken into account in the development of policies and plans for adaptation to climate change in Nepal and investigates the opportunities and progress made toward mainstreaming gender into policy more widely. Whilst the recommendations presented are particularly tailored for Nepal, they also have wider relevance to other contexts. Some of the mechanisms identified to promote the mainstreaming of gender in climate change policies include: a need for disaggregated data on livelihood strategies; a community-led, bottom-up approach to identify challenges; the empowerment and capacity building of women to adapt to climate change; detailed and context specific research on the differential impacts of climate change on women and men drawing on the existing local knowledge; the strengthening of existing organisations and initiatives which already have gender equity objectives; the strengthening of existing legal frameworks and tools. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Forests and climate are both prominent issues within policies and media in Bangladesh, as well as on the global level. This study analyses media discourses from 1989 to 2010 from the International Herald Tribune and The Daily Ittefaq. The quantitative content analysis finds substantial differences between forest and climate discourses. The hypothesis that the international media drives the national media discourse is rejected. National print media (The Daily Ittefaq) primarily frames the discussion around the adverse impact of climate change on forests in Bangladesh, whereas the international print media (International Herald Tribune) frames the discussion around the mitigating role of forests. In other words, forests are described as a solution opportunity to climate change. Journalists and politicians are the main actors in national print media, whereas scientist, non-governmental organisations and international organisations are the main voices in international print media. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>our medical education in Bangladesh has failed to produce efficient professionals considering the need of the people and time. The proofs are plenty. Many a people opt to get medical treatment abroad if their financial ability permits to. There are substantial reports that have criticized medical education for emphasizing scientific knowledge over biologic understanding, clinical reasoning, practical skill, and the development of character,
compassion, and integrity. More and more frustrations have been expressed in the Dailies almost frequently and regularly. How did this situation arise, and what can be done about it? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document talks about Strategy for Department of Essential Health Technologies (EHT) of WHO. Essential health technologies are evidence-based technologies that provide cost-effective solutions to health problems. Health technologies are used at every level of the health care system. From the simplest to the most advanced, they form the backbone of the services medicine can offer in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness and disease. The Department of Essential Health Technologies (EHT) has arisen out of what was formerly the Department of Blood Safety and Clinical Technology (BCT). The renaming of the department does not mean that WHO will give less priority to blood safety activities than in the previous four years. Rather, it reflects the recognition that many other health technologies play equally important roles as blood transfusion in prevention and health care and so also deserve to be given priority. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Infertility is a couple's problem. Almost 50% case males are responsible for infertility. Most common cause is oligospermia and azoospermia and approximately 5% to 15% of men with azoospermia and severe oligospermia may have a chromosomal abnormality. Men with significant spermatogenic compromise are the candidates of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Raised FSH level above 9 is an indication of spermatogenic compromise. So, medical treatment for these patients is waste of time and money. Early attempt of assisted reproduction is ideal to avoid the crisis of total spermatogenic failure in near future. But before going for ICSI genetic testing if possible and proper counseling about possibilities of transmission of genetic disease to offspring is necessary. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Yaque del Sur watershed in the Dominican Republic is already under severe water stress. The population of the area is much poorer than the national average and livelihoods are dependent on cash crops and subsistence agriculture. Cyclones, storms, floods and droughts regularly damage crops and infrastructure in the watershed. This report highlights how climate change is likely to cause additional stress to the vulnerable area. It notes that current coping strategies may be insufficient to deal with future climate risks and it presents issues that efforts to manage climate risks in Yaque del Sur should focus on, including: selecting crop varieties that use less water; climate-proofing access roads; building water reservoirs for domestic and agricultural use; establishing agroforestry and payment for ecosystem services systems to promote reforestation in the upper watershed; increasing irrigation efficiency; and improved monitoring and accessibility of climate data. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Educators, policy makers, and others around the world are concerned about meeting the educational targets of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Education For All (EFA) with the approaching deadline of 2015. More children than ever are in school, but some reports indicate that the quality of education in many developing countries has actually dropped in recent years. To understand these trends, educational specialists will need improved assessments of learning. The present volume provides a review of quality learning assessments, their status in terms of the empirical knowledge base, and some new ideas for improving their effectiveness, particularly for those children most in need. The main question addressed in this report may be summarized as follows: Can the available research on the assessment of learning (particularly regarding learning to read) contribute to a more effective way to improve educational outcomes in developing countries? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This technical bulletin is a part of the MSM GF Technical Bulletin Series focusing on Treatment 2.0. What is Treatment 2.0? Designed and developed by UNAIDS and the WHO in June 2010, Treatment 2.0 is an overarching HIV/AIDS strategy that aims to markedly improve access to, and optimize the prevention benefit of, antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. The 10-year initiative articulates the need for a coordinated plan of action across multilateral, bilateral, and country-level agencies to dramatically simplify and scale up efforts toward universal access to HIV care and treatment. This bulletin gives information on context of Treatment 2.0. The foreseeable challenges and barriers to achieving the goals of Treatment 2.0. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Nipah is a viral zoonotic disease transmitted by infected fruit juice specially raw palm juice unpastuerised, contaminated fruits eaten by fruit bats and taking it without washing, peeling or cooking1,2. Since 1997 Nipah virus infection has emerged repeatedly in South East Asia including Bangladesh. The first case of Nipah virus infection was reported in Malaysia in 1998-99 and retrospective diagnosis showed the infection was present from 19973. First infection in India was reported in January-February 2001 in Shiliguri
district neighbouring Bangladesh where 66 cases were reported with a 74% mortality. 75% patients were hospital staff or had visited one of the other patients in hospital indicating person to person contact. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Natural disaster is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. Almost every year Bangladesh suffers highly by different kinds of disasters like flood, tropical cyclones, tornados, tidal surges, droughts and large scale river erosion etc. A large number of the total population of our country lives in the coastal areas. According to the population census 2001, the whole coastal area of the country has about 46 million people. The average size of the household is 7, the density of population is 743 per sq. km. Womenfolk are 49% of the coastal population, while 23% (8 million) are urban-dwellers, size of the labor force (15-59 years age group) is 18.6 million which are about 53% of the coastal population (BBS 2006). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In 2002, the Programme took on a new title, “Pan Asia ICT R&amp;D Grants Programme” with IDRC, APDIP and APNIC as the primary contributors. AMIC is the administrative partner, and subsequently ISOC and Microsoft joined as the additional
supporting organisations. These important collaborations serve as catalysts for the evolution of the Programme to a
broader ownership-base that involves key national, regional, and international agencies in the Asia-pacific region.
This publication is produced to facilitate prospective partners’ participation in the Programme. This publication will provide researchers in the Asia-Pacific region with ideas on the opportunities that exist in the ICT sector, and encourage them to engage in research and development efforts to advance regional, national, and local interests. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This collection of contributions by gender and sustainable development experts explores the interconnections between gender equality and sustainable development across a range of sectors and issues such as energy, health, education, food security, climate change, human rights, consumption and production patterns, and urbanisation. The articles provide evidence on how women’s equal access and control over resources not only improves livelihoods, but also helps ensure the sustainability of the environment. Recommendations for policy makers and practitioners include: develop a participatory and gender-responsive consultation process to inform and ensure equitable decision-making; commit to building a green economy based on gender equality, poverty eradication, and technological and social systems that reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption; decrease women’s growing burden of unpaid labour by increasing their access to appropriate technologies and natural resources. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This 21-page report shares findings of a study to investigate the potential impact of radio broadcasts of Search for Common Ground's The Team series on Kenyan citizens’ attitudes related to tolerance, communication, and participation in political processes. The study found that exposure to the programme appears related to pro-social attitudes about political engagement regarding people from different religious and ethnic groups. Listening to the programme is also positively related to interpersonal communication with family and friends about politics and tolerance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper reports on a study that developed a model for implementing local e-government in Uganda, as an example of a developing country. The model which builds on an existing one defines dimensions of financial constraints, ICT infrastructure, sensitization, training and social political factors as pre-requisites for successfully implementing local e-government projects in Uganda. The need to implement local e-government for improved service delivery is well documented and various models have been proposed for this important task. However, existing models are known to be suited for implementing e-government in the developed countries at the national level. In the developing countries, the technical and non-technical infrastructures are not as mature as those of developed countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Because of the potential for negative environmental and social impacts, extractive industries are often viewed as posing a threat to more traditional livelihood activities, such as agriculture or raising livestock, and even to the development of more value-added or serviceorientated economic sectors, like tourism. Competing views about the best use of land can also fuel social conflict. This Brief presents land use planning as a tool to mitigate these risks. It describes the basic steps in land use planning, explains the extent to which five Latin American countries are using the methodology, and draws out lessons from the region’s experiences that may be useful for other countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report aims to provide insights that will help enhance the on-going research partnership in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) R&amp;D between India and European Union (EU) member states. The European Commission (EC) is keen on enhancing the partnership with India in the ICT R&amp;D domain, via the Framework Programmes (FP). This report also aims at augmenting the goals of the Joint Working Group (JWG) set up to identify the technology priorities areas common to India and EU member states such that their collaborations be accelerated. This report describes results of a foresight study on the ICT R&amp;D priority areas which India will work upon in the next 2, 5 and 10 years. The delphi method was used. Three rounds were conducted to understand whether the technology priorities identified in the first round were valid and accurate. Thirty visionaries were interviewed to obtain the results reported here. Visionaries were carefully
selected based on criteria described in the report. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Despite the wealth of studies on health and healthcare-seeking behaviour among the Bengali population in Bangladesh, relatively few studies have focused specifically on the tribal groups in the country. This study aimed at exploring the context, reasons, and choices in patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviour of the hill tribal population of Bangladesh to present the obstacles and challenges faced in accessing healthcare provision in the tribal areas. Participatory tools and techniques, including focus-group discussions, in-depth interviews, and participant-observations, were used involving 218 men, women, adolescent boys, and girls belonging to nine different tribal communities in six districts. Data were transcribed and analyzed using the narrative analysis approach. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper reviews the issues facing African countries in adopting information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance governance in four areas, reducing poverty, providing basic human needs, improving public administration, and enhancing democratization. It summarizes the use of ICTs in these areas – both successes and failures – around the world and in Africa. The theme in our overview of ICT in governance is that ICTs are neutral and that human choices will determine how ICT will be used and whether the revolution in ICTs will benefit all of Africa. The paper focuses on many of the caveats that should accompany ICT deployment and ends with an action framework for practitioners anxious to get started. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The present study titled Technological Upgradation in the Jute
Mills: Challenges and Way Out has been carried out with this broad objective. More specifically the study has examined the market potentials of jute goods at local and international levels; investigated the current status of jute mills in terms of machines, workers, working environment and production process;analysed the productivity and efficiency of jute mills; and estimated the possible gains through improvement of efficiency in the jute mills. Based on the findings, the study put forward necessary
suggestions to modernise the machineries, improve the production process, and develop human resources in the jute manufacturing sector. The study is based on the data collected from 10 sample jute mills of both spinning and composite categories which are under the authority or membership of Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), Bangladesh Jute Mills Association (BJMA) and Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper aims at exploring what are the real impacts of ICTs to NGOs engaged in e-governance. There has been an assumption or normative expectation that the use of ICTs can stimulate innovative capacity within and among NGOs. This innovative capacity, however, could lead NGOs into new forms of hybrids that do not easily map onto conventional images of NGOs. This brings with it the risk that NGOs will encounter problems of accountability that undermine rather than enhance their responsiveness to social change. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper argues that the inadequacies of the international inter-state climate change negotiating processes create a pressing need for innovative modes of governance, and it proposes the construction of a transnational climate change regime (TCCR). The regime would forge stronger cross-border links among non-state actors and organisations, allowing them to address climate issues in a coordinated and collaborative manner. It would operate at multiple levels of authority and scale, enabling transnational institutions to directly engage and address intra-governmental, sub-state and societal actors within countries. In this way the regime would bypass the governments of recalcitrant states, and states lacking governance capacity. The paper concludes that a TCCR is not a panacea, but it provides a feasible way to bypass recalcitrant states and fill governance gaps. By managing states, it can promote more robust international processes, strengthening global climate governance as a whole. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This volume outlines the complex pressures exerted by the effects of climate change on the events which swept through the Middle East in 2010 and 2011, exploring the long-term trends in precipitation, agriculture, food prices and migration which contributed to the social instability and violence which has transformed the region. The publication does not argue that climate change caused the revolutions, but the collection of essays suggest that the consequences of climate change are stressors that can ignite a volatile mix of underlying causes that erupt into revolution. The authors conclude that climate change has acted as a threat multiplier, exacerbating environmental, social, economic and political drivers of unrest and it will likely continue to do so in the Middle East and North Africa region. In this context, addressing the effects of climate change will be critical for ensuring the longer-term stability of the region and legitimacy of its respective governments. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This new global strategy articulates the determination and strengths of the International HIV/Aids Alliance. It has been developed through wide consultation with Linking Organisations and other partners, and has been approved by an international board of trustees. The strategy provides high-level direction and sets 17 ambitious but measurable goals for the whole Alliance. The targets have been set up until 2015, at which point progress will be reviewed and the goals revised up until 2020 accordingly. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper seeks will to assess Tunisia’s transition and ponder the outcome of the period, as a whole. Before anything else, the author stresses, it is important to approach the issue in the context of the need to resolve the pending questions regarding the fate of the transition itself, and people’s expectations of it. The turmoil we are witnessing today, the paper states, reflects major expectations that have become more urgent than any time before, prompting the need to embark on a process of major reforms. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls is the priority theme of the 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women to be held 4-15 March 2013. In order to contribute to a deeper understanding of the issue and to assist the Commission in its deliberations, UN Women in collaboration with other UN agencies and the WHO convened an expert group meeting (EGM) on &amp;lsquo;Prevention of violence against women and girls&amp;rsquo; in September 2012 in Bangkok, Thailand. This report reflects the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the EGM and presents key findings and recommendations which provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW. Experts pointed out that, in order for violence prevention programmes to be effective, national, provincial and local governments, communities, civil society groups, donors, the private sector and other non-state actors must work in partnerships with women&amp;rsquo;s organisations. Also efforts to prevent violence against women and girls must be long-term and grounded in communities so that work to change unequal power relations between women and men is carried out consistently. Civil society organisations (CSOS) have often driven efforts to change social norms that have implicitly perpetuated violence against women and girls but governments have a key role to support and create an environment where CSOs can develop innovative and sustainable programmes and work safely from discrimination and violence themselves. It was also found that involving men and boys in violence prevention programmes has been very successful because they can lead to a decrease in men&amp;rsquo;s violence against women and a change of attitudes towards gender equality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations were offered to work on different initiatives, including: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; a global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; a global advocacy campaign for prevention; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; more research on the causes and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; mass and new media. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the following areas: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; urban youth and armed gang violence; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; conflict and natural disasters; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; girls, adolescent girls and young women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experts noted that prevention of violence against women and girls remains a poorly understood concept across sectors and stakeholders and that there is a need to build not only evidence, but shared understandings of the complexity and causes of violence against women and girls, and of how it can be effectively prevented. This transformative agenda engages all levels of the socio-political system, from policy and legislative development, to the development and delivery of programmes and services &amp;lsquo;on the ground&amp;rsquo;, and the capacity building of the institutions responsible for implementation. As well as effective response mechanisms, specific actions to address the foundations of violence &amp;ndash; discriminatory and violence-supportive practices, laws, norms, behaviours and attitudes &amp;ndash; are also necessary in order to prevent violence against women and girls from happening in the first place, within and across all settings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This report built on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the Background Paper prepared by the rapporteur, which are available at http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study contains recommendations on use of ICT in Healthcare and Knowledge management for the National Knowledge Commission. To address the problems, the government has launched major national initiatives
such as National Rural Health Mission, establishment of six new AIIMS like institutions, up gradation of existing public
hospitals and labs, etc. Management of communicable as well as non-communicable diseases has also been a major area of concern to the government. An Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) is already under implementation. The Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Surveillance under IDSP will track trends of selected major risk factors in the urban and rural population, aged between 15 and 64 years. Innovative systems are, however, required for quick reporting of such incidents when they occur and to implement an effective system of intervention to provide the best diagnostic and medical care to the affected patients and prevent further spread of the disease &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have become common place entities in all aspects of life. Across the past twenty years the use of ICT has fundamentally changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of endeavor within business and governance. Within education, ICT has begun to have a presence but the impact has not been as extensive as in other fields. Education is a very socially oriented activity and quality education has increased. The use of ICT in education lends itself to more student-centered learning. India has made impressive strides in the application of ICT in recent years and this is reflected in its vibrant and fast growing economy. Here, we will find out the awareness about the ICT among people and the impact of IT on students. Highlight the factors prevents reaping the benefits of ICTs and technological innovations to access them. Also identifies the bottlenecks in system. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines cyclicality in fiscal and monetary policies including capital flows in 28 Asian countries and explains the cyclicality of fiscal policy by considering the effects of corruption and democracy. The paper analyses the nature of macroeconomic policies adopted by these Asian countries and the underlying factors behind such choices. The analysis brings out four key stylised facts. First, fiscal policy and capital flows are mostly pro-cyclical in lower income countries and a-cyclical (or slightly counter-cyclical) in higher income countries. Second, monetary policy is mostly a-cyclical (or slightly pro-cyclical) in lower income countries and counter-cyclical in higher income countries. Third, emerging East Asian countries show more pro-cyclical fiscal policy than South Asian and Middle Eastern countries. Fourth, there is a positive correlation between corruption and pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh is a land scarce country where per capita cultivated land is only 12.5 decimals.The present study estimates the rate of land conversion and consequent loss of agricultural production of the country besides determining the factors affecting such conversion. The study is based mainly on field survey covering 24 villages from six divisions of the country Annual Conversion of farm land is estimated to be 0.56 per cent and the country’s loss of rice production is also estimated to be between 0.86 and 1.16 per cent. The converted land is predominantly used for construction of houses, followed by roads and establishment of business enterprises. The land poor records higher rate of land conversion. The two principal determining factors for such conversion are found to be land ownership size of a household and the non-agricultural occupation of household heads. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper we present here discusses ICT innovation in India using a narrative framework. We argue that ICT innovation has not really been a subject matter sufficiently researched in information systems from the perspective of innovation in developing countries. We use a grounded theory inspired approach and we discovered three narratives of innovation in India; a) the supply narrative, b) the technology narrative and c) the collaborative narrative. We detect the evolution of these narratives and aim to continue further work to understand the factors involved in the emergence and shift of these narratives on a more granular level. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Kenya’s heavy reliance on hydroelectricity production has made the country vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as drought and erratic rainfall patterns. According to this ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, Kenya needs to develop a more resilient and stable supply of electricity, while rapidly developing its base load of electricity production to meet growing demand. Geothermal energy plays a critical role in this, which is also noted in Kenya’s Vision 2030 strategy. The brief highlights how Kenya has catalysed a productive geothermal sector by establishing a specialist government institution, the Geothermal Development Company, which shoulders some of the financial risk for the private sector at exploration, appraisal and drilling stages. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This case study from Cameroon’s Sudan-Sahel region explores the impact of rainfall on agricultural production and the evidence that supports small-scale farming as a strategy to reduce the vulnerability of crop yields to rainfall variation in the region. Climate data for 20 years and crop production data for six major food crops for the same years are used to identify patterns of correlation. The analysis reveals that the influence of rainfall on agriculture can be diluted by proactive policies that support food production. Proactive policies also reduce the impact of climatic shocks on agricultural production. The findings emphasise the extent of vulnerability of food crop production to rainfall variation among small-holder farmers and reinforce the call for the proactive engagement of relevant institutions and support services in assisting the efforts of small-scale food producers in Africa’s Sudan-Sahel. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This manual for trainers and community health workers (CHWs) concentrates specifically upon childhood malaria and its danger signs, clarifying the conditions for use of pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key messages include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;symptoms of fever in a child can evolve in a very short time to become severe malaria with convulsions or other danger signs, thus delays in giving treatment means their symptoms get worse, and can cause death &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the success of pre-referral treatment depends on how well CHWs communicate with the child's caregiver and how early the child is brought for treatment &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;danger signs of malaria must be carefully looked for; for example, fever must be recognised and unusually sleepy or unconscious must be noticed &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;if danger signs of severe malaria exist, the child must be treated with an artesunate suppository and referred urgently to the health facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Furthermore, critical recommendations are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to identify the child's problems, CHWs have to learn how to ask the right questions of the caregiver and then look at the child for signs of illness &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a suppository is not a complete treatment, it is used once as emergency treatment for a child with danger signs of severe malaria; therefore, CHWs must be firm and explain that this medicine alone is not enough &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;finding a solution for transporting a child with a danger sign to a health facility is crucial; solutions can be found at the community level &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to help immediate treatment at the health facility, a referral note should be written for the health facility, and the caregiver need to understand the importance of timely care and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>This study was conducted amongst 189 respondents in Papua New Guinea (PNG) using structured questionnaires distributed to different groups of respondents using stratified random sampling. The results indicate that e-governance has the potential to improve service delivery and customer satisfaction. It is also confirmed through the findings in this research that the expectations of citizens from public services are quite high, but experience has often been negative i.e. there is a huge variance in the perception and expectation of normal citizens in the country regarding service delivery, quality of services. This has negatively affected customer satisfaction over the number of years. It is concluded that there is an urgent need in PNG to employ e-governance in all public agencies in view of prevailing problems of service quality. E-governance should be seen as a means of improving service quality in the future. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this paper is to show how information and communications technology (ICT) literacy skills reflect twenty-first century requirements for researching and communicating information in digital environments. An interactive problem-based, scenario-based, web-based assessment tool, iSkillsTM, has been developed through a broad-based effort to establish standards for performance and certification of ICT literacy proficiencies. This paper aims to discuss the assessment’s potential in determining the effectiveness of instruction programs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Policy-related literature on clean technology transfer and development has so far paid little attention to the characteristics and drivers of international companies. This paper aims to help open the debate on business and policymaking in the context of clean technology transfer by discussing aspects that influence corporate responses: sector-specific and company-specific peculiarities, as well as those related to country contexts (both origin countries and host countries to companies). It notes that most of the climate-related investments have been geared to a few emerging economies, but there is potential for extension to other developing areas. However, this requires market co-creation by joint business and governmental efforts. The paper also highlights that although viable business models are largely lacking, a variety of modalities has emerged over the years, ranging from fully commercial to primarily publicly funded and involving different types of actors and countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the context of urbanisation, disaster risk increases as a result of badly planned and managed urban development, degraded ecosystems and poverty. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) processes developed in several Latin American cities show the benefits of making risk reduction an integral part of local development. The importance of good information for risk assessment, government-civil society collaboration, and links between local, national and regional levels of government is also evident. Latin America’s DRR experiences can offer a wealth of lessons for African and South Asian counterparts embarking on their own urban risk reduction processes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>One in every four of the world&amp;rsquo;s people lives in fragile and conflicted settings. This handbook is an Asian-based attempt to encourage new thinking and mainstreaming of innovative engagement in fragile situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper highlights that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;fragile and conflict-affected situation (FCAS) countries lag far behind in development &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;for development aid to be effective, modes of engagement must be customised to the specific needs and local context of the affected country &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;failure to engage in fragile and conflict-affected situations differently and in an innovative manner is likely to entail major human, social, economic, and security costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author states that in terms of FCAS, there are common challenges, as well as lessons from how development agencies are already responding to these circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;programmatic approach to fragile and conflict-affected situations is needed, yet flexibility is required - significant adjustments during the implementation are likely to exist&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a deeper understanding of the country contexts, longer term commitment to working in with other partners in the country and increasing presence on the ground are critical ingredients for efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;depending on the stage of conflict and fragility, the country strategy may be formulated as a country partnership strategy, an interim operational strategy, a regional strategy, or a watching brief&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in FCAS countries, it is recommended to anticipate potential problems before they occur, thus a security management risk perspective and an evaluation of the full range of risks to which communities are exposed are of great importance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;assessment tools are essential to understand the FCAS setting and to effectively formulate appropriate operational strategies and assistance program development&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this sense, political economy analysis can contribute to improved prioritisation of reform efforts, and social assessment can help identifying proper assistance delivery approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document also underlines that a national development policy dialogue is totally required. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change is an issue that affects lives of millions of people across the world. Therefore, this study urges that the integration of climate risk considerations into policy should be increased, in order to ensure that development proceeds along pathways that are resilient to climate change. The paper shows that in particular ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches have proved to provide flexible, cost-effective and broadly applicable alternatives for reducing the impacts of climate change and as such are a critical tool for adaptation planners to help them tackle climate change threats. This paper reviews the rapidly evolving concept of ecosystems-based approaches to climate change adaptation and its role in addressing multiple scale risks, vulnerabilities and opportunities. Fundamentally, EbA is the use of natural capital by people to adapt to climate change impacts, which can also have multiple co-benefits for mitigation, protection of livelihoods and poverty alleviation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Technology is evolving at an exponential rate. Teaching demands and the changed face of education add pressures to an existing teaching populace. Loss of expertise and an undersupply of ICT skilled teachers, heralds an age of extreme concern. We have to realize that ICT is here to stay, and its infusion into every aspect of daily life cannot be argued or disbanded. So, for today’s society to function effectively, ‘highly competent teachers must present tomorrow’s school graduates with the highest quality of schooling. Through professional development or retraining the teacher models life-long learning and acquires good ICT skills incorporated into a new pedagogical approach. The skills and knowledge of the older teacher then evolves in to a rich tapestry of knowledge that can only serve to create fuller teaching styles that will ultimately benefit the student and society. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Global ICT Programs introduce new and universal modes of organizing centered on innovation and technology initiatives and implemented through a novel mix of policy instruments, international institutions, business interests and techno/ managerial concepts. In eGovernment initiatives, for instance, which include portals and other mechanisms to provide a single point of access for a set of services and interactive applications, Global ICT Programs bring together the government, the private sector and a plethora of international institutions situated across various boundaries, territories and organizational domains. Jordan is an interesting case study of such an attempted transformation in government and public/private relationships. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This 62-page report shares findings of research conducted during the Media Map Project, focusing on the media sector, governance, and development in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the report, donor support to media should facilitate the media's independence from the government and other outside influences, promote its freedom to disseminate information to the public, and to represent the public's needs to decision-makers, and improve the quality of the news produced. In turn, such an improved news media should keep the government transparent, vitalise the market economy, and provide citizens with critical information to hold their governments to account. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Widespread violations are being committed against female students in Ugandan schools (including rape, defilement and sexual harassment); yet these cases often go unreported. This is a step-by-step teacher training manual for preventing and managing sexualised violence against girls in schools. The goal of this training is to equip teachers with information and skills to support children and other stakeholders in the protection of female students from sexual gender-based violence. It is meant to build the capacity of teachers to identify, counsel and report cases while respecting childrens&amp;rsquo; rights. This publication was produced following a 2009 Action for Development study showing that sexual violence against women is a widespread problem in Uganda, with rising incidence rates. Action for Development then designed this training to increase anti-sexual violence norms, values and life skills. The production of this guide was supported by the Independent Development Fund (IDF). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This is a background paper for the Addressing Inequalities Global Thematic Consultation for the post-2015 development agenda. Based on learning from MDG3, existing research, and the experiences of GADN members, authors Jessica Woodroffe and Sharon Smee of the UK Gender and Development Network (GADN) argue that, without a strong and explicit focus on gender equality and women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment, the post-2015 framework will fail to achieve the social transformations required to eradicate poverty and empower the people who are most excluded.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They see the necessity for a twin-track approach to address structural gender inequalities: a stand-alone goal on gender equality, together with mainstreaming gender across the framework. They emphasise that a standalone goal on gender is essential to foster the political will, resources and national ownership needed to create sustainable and effective action. The authors also explain the importance of transformative targets that reflect lasting change in the power and choices women have. Political will and technical capacity should be directed toward making data available to measure these targets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific recommendations are made for ensuring that gender equality remains an international priority in the post-2015 framework, and that the energy and investment expended to date is not wasted. They include the following: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Focus on the most marginalised people in society, recognising that the majority of these people are women and girls. &lt;br /&gt;- Reflect an understanding that women&amp;rsquo;s poverty is, in part, a result of their socially enforced gender roles and relations and that without specifically addressing the causes of gender inequality women&amp;rsquo;s poverty will persist. &lt;br /&gt;- Gender equality and women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment should be mainstreamed throughout the framework by: agreeing specific targets under each goal that reflect the gender barriers women and girls face and attempt to tackle the structural causes; developing gender sensitive indicators, based primarily on need rather than availability of data; and substantially increasing the availability of sex-disaggregated data. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional information: &lt;br /&gt;More gender resources related to the Global Thematic Consultation on Addressing Inequalities in the post-2015 development agenda can be found at: http://www.worldwewant2015.org/node/268948/folder/134342 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document reports on how the use of e-learning has developed in Europe since the Lisbon European Council of 2000. It also draws conclusions for the next stage. It follows the e-learning priorities agreed by the European institutions and Member States, focusing first on teachers and schools and second on higher education, while taking other education sectors into account. It identifies the challenges posed by the need for quality and efficiency, and in particular for pedagogical, technological and organisational innovation. The report aims at summarising the main trends on the use of ICT as a tool to support efficiently learning lifelong and life-wide. Its goal is further to feed directly into the upcoming discussions on 'An updated strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training' in line with the Lisbon strategy and the renewed Social Agenda. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become commonplace entities in all aspects of life. Across the past twenty years the use of ICT has fundamentally changed the practices and procedures of nearly all forms of endeavour within business and governance. Within education, ICT has begun to have a presence but the value of ICT is not affordable.
Unfortunately, there are some limitations confronting institutions in Nigeria from infusing ICT. The basic principle of cloud computing entails the reduction of in-house data centres and the delegation of a portion or all of the Information Technology infrastructure capability to a third party. This holds the promise of driving down cost while fostering innovation and promoting
agility. Institutions of higher learning, such as Universities and Colleges, are the core of innovation through their advanced research and development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>GNP+ has recently finalised and published two documents which aim to enhance the greater and more meaningful involvement of young people living with HIV within the HIV response. Supported by funding from the HIV Young Leaders Fund, GNP+ conducted research among 350 young people living with HIV, and among over 175 youth led organisations and networks living with HIV, to identify the key barriers faced by YPLHIV to engaging more meaningfully in the HIV response. The findings from this research led to the development of these two tools: - the GIYPA Roadmap: Supporting Young People Living with HIV to be Meaningfully Involved in the HIV Response -and GIYPA Guidebook: Supporting Organisations and Networks to Scale Up the Meaningful Involvement of Young People Living with HIV. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study focuses on the current use of e-learning in the EU. The perspective of the study is forward-looking as the study focuses on the possible future use of e-learning emphasising its potentials. The study particularly focuses on the role of e-learning in strengthening the integration of theory and practice in iVET. The study therefore emphasises the apprehension of whether and in what way the use of e-learning for teaching and learning can integrate the theoretical and the practical world. The study is based on a desk study, an expert workshop, 65 telephone interviews (with experts, government representatives, stakeholders and ma
nagers of iVET institutions) and seven good-practice case studies. It must be stressed, that as the case studies are good practice examples they are not representative for Europe. In addition, due to the scope of the study the picture
painted of the general situation in Europe is very broad-brush. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This handbook by the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Africa Adaptation Programme (AAP) focuses on climate change adaptation experiences and aims to build the capacity of adaptation programmes and project teams. It argues that good communication strategies and knowledge management are critical to achieving high impacts from capitalisation initiatives. The handbook recommends capitalisation of experiences as an exercise that extracts lessons learned to inspire future actions and promote mutual learning opportunities among different actors. The handbook is divided into two parts: the first part outlines key concepts; the second describes the steps and tools required for the capitalisation of climate change adaptation experiences. The aim is not to provide a ready-made recipe, but methodological orientations that can be adapted to the specific contexts of each country and programme. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Urban settlements in the Pacific islands continue to flourish despite the lack of planning and services, and have become a permanent feature of the Pacific landscape. Yet, this urbanisation has been largely ignored, as governments and development agencies have tended to focus their attention on rural development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings encompass:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;urbanisation is happening in the Pacific at increasing rates, and in most cases there is no enough preparation to cope with the challenges and opportunities it presents &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;poverty in the Pacific is increasingly concentrated in urban areas, and occurs predominately in the squatter and informal settlements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document demonstrates that many Pacific governments have attempted a policy of decentralisation of government functions, but often with little success. However, there are a number of steps that can move the urban agenda in the right direction:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;national political leadership should accept the reality that urban populations will continue to increase, and that the option of &amp;ldquo;sending them back&amp;rdquo; is no longer viable &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;national policies should reflect the fact that poverty is an urban phenomenon, and Pacific governments and donors should no longer fear investing in urban areas&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investing in education and skills training is necessary; it will help align a growing services-based work force &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;developing the productive capacity of the agricultural and fisheries sectors is needed not only to feed growing urban centers but also to revitalise rural economic opportunity, which can mitigate the rates of urbanisation &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;similarly, land issues need to be put on the table and resolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper concludes that urbanisation needs to be seen and managed as a national priority. Still, a better understanding of the social, cultural, economic and political relationships between urban and rural areas will better inform policies to define how towns and cities should evolve. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report, conducted by GreenStream together with Climate Focus, argues that the global carbon market currently faces a deep demand crisis. The consequent price fall reduces the incentive to make low carbon investments and thus increases the risk of locking in carbon-intensive infrastructure. However, despite the current lack of ambitious global climate policy, various market-based approaches are emerging around the world, indicating increasing scope and fragmentation of the carbon markets. This report analyses the status and outlook of global carbon markets and identifies measures and circumstances for creating new demand for carbon credits, taking into account the trend towards fragmentation of carbon markets. It concludes that demand for international credits will come mainly from voluntary pledges, marking a shift from demand by commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information Communication Technology (ICT) has the potential to contribute to development, especially in rural areas of developing countries. But the mechanisms through which ICT can be combined with development agendas and an understanding of the actual development process and impacts of ICT are less well understood or properly defined in the academic literature. This research is an attempt to contribute to understanding this process by analysing the impact of two ICT initiatives in Bangladesh, aimed at improving the lives of rural women. An interpretive approach in the qualitative research tradi-tion was adopted to identify emergent themes in this study. Our findings indicate that these ICT projects have significantly improved the socio-economic opportunities of many women. This paper will be useful for those academics, practitioners and policymakers who wish to enhance their understanding of ICT projects in rural areas of developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The key theme of the ICT FOR ALL project is to support the inclusion and accessibility goals of the i2010 strategic framework by enhancing quality of life through ICT. The framework pays specific attention to people at risk of exclusion by virtue of age, gender, disability, literacy, culture, poverty, education, unemployment, geography and social isolation. ICT FOR ALL has two clear yardsticks against which results can be evaluated:
[1] the extent to which the project will succeed in understanding the barriers of target group communities in being able to access the social
benefits of ICT, and 
[2] the extent to which this understanding will assist policy development to ensure wider access to and uptake of ICT and realise the potential of e- Inclusion.

ICT FOR ALL is a consortium of 5 partner organisations from Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland and the UK with relevant experience in technology, social research, market research, policy development and innovation and inclusion. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Thailand. Despite Thailand&amp;rsquo;s numerous innovations in the global AIDS response, men who have sex with men (MSM)&amp;nbsp;have been virtually absent in national strategic plans until 2007. Once MSM entered routine national surveillance, evidence for a rapidly growing HIV epidemic among MSM became available. HIV prevalence among MSM in Bangkok was estimated to be 17.3 percent in 2003, 28.3 percent in 2005, 30.7 in 2007, and 24.7 in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the response, MSM received HIV prevention services to the extent that male sex workers were targeted in the 100 percent Condom Use Programme. In 2003,  the &amp;lsquo;Law and Order Campaign&amp;rsquo; introduced punitive and legalistic policies that punished gay venue management for providing condoms and lubricant. The campaign is regarded as a significant setback to Thailand&amp;rsquo;s HIV response. Common HIV prevention tools rapidly disappeared from gay venues during this period. While the situation is much improved, barriers to offering effective prevention services still exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid spread of HIV among MSM during 2003-2007 was gradually matched by an increase in attention from national and international stakeholders, including in Thailand&amp;rsquo;s National HIV Plan beginning in 2007. The ambitious new plan got to a slow start after the country&amp;rsquo;s HIV prevention budget was cut by approximately two-thirds in 2006.  A revised budget for 2007-2011 allocated 8.1 percent of HIV prevention resources to HIV prevention services for MSM. Although only 0.8 percent of HIV prevention resources were spent on MSM programmes in 2009, this value increased to 5.4 percent in 2010 and 8.2 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Thailand reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The history of the Pacific is a history of migration, yet modern barriers to migration impede development in the Pacific island countries facing degraded resources and high rates of population increase. This paper examines international migration in the Pacific, and argues that there should be greater opportunities for the people of Pacific countries to migrate between their home states and the developed states of the Pacific rim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author indicates that migration from Pacific islands to the Pacific rim can be a powerful tool for promoting human development in the region, which suffers from limited land and marine resources and high rates of population growth. In this context, both the US and New Zealand have been reasonably generous in facilitating migration from two Pacific islands. However, Australia stands out as the Pacific neighbour with the greatest possibility to develop new migration streams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;developed states (particularly Australia) should assist developing states of the Pacific by promoting controlled migration because it is an effective means of giving development assistance and fostering stronger regional relations&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;preferential visa quotas and seasonal worker schemes go some way towards satisfying the needs of Pacific islanders but other options should also be addressed &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the arguments for more permeable borders do not affect all Pacific countries equally - the greatest priority should be to enhance labour mobility for countries facing very challenging circumstances &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Still, the paper emphasises that migration is one avenue for improving the position of Pacific islanders, but must be considered alongside other policy initiatives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;The biennial Gender Chart, an addendum to the Millennium Development Goals Report, depicts the situation of women and girls in developing regions with indicators used to monitor the MDGs. It is divided into eight sections &amp;ndash; one for each goal. Although some progress has been made in a number of the gender dimensions, more needs to be done in every country and at every level to reduce persistently high levels of inequality based on sex. The following are some of the findings: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 1: Globally, women continue to be more likely to live in poverty than men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 2: More children are in school, but gender gaps still exist. Little progress has been made since the 1990s in closing secondary attendance gender gaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 3: There are large gender gaps in business ownership. Women continue to gain representation in parliaments, but the pace of change is slow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 4: Under-five girls are more likely to survive than boys, except in Southern Asia where, in some countries, mortality rates still reflect practices related to son preference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 5: Age at the time of first marriage is rising, but women in poor and rural areas continue to marry young. During childbirth, urban rich women are much more likely to be assisted by a skilled health professional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 6: Every year, more than one in five new HIV infections take place among young women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 7: Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind the rest of world in access to water. Where water sources are not readily accessible, women and girls often bear the burden of collection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goal 8: While the total amount of bilateral sector-allocable aid has increased, the proportion devoted to gender equality objectives has stalled. Because of the crosscutting nature of the gender goal, assistance to gender programmes should be increased in order to pave the way for attainment of the MDGs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gender Chart was co-produced by UN Women and the UN Statistics Division for the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on MDGs Indicators. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional information: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An audio interview with UN Women&amp;rsquo;s Laura Turquet and the United Nations&amp;rsquo; Keiko Osaki Tomita regarding the 2012 Gender Chart can be heard at: https://soundcloud.com/un-women/2012-mdg-gender-chart &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Informal economy has been a prominent feature of Bangladesh&amp;rsquo;s economy over the years. This report presents important information on the informal economy in Bangladesh, which can serve as inputs to evidence-based formulation of sector policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper highlights that the informal economy plays a significant in terms of the number of jobs it creates and its contribution to total economic output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;informal employment dominates the country&amp;rsquo;s labour market, being estimated at about 89% of the total number of jobs, with female reporting a higher incidence &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;informal sector accounted for more than 40% of the total gross value added of Bangladesh in 2010, with the highest contributions in agriculture and fishery&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;however, informal workers are occasionally disadvantaged comparing with formal workers, particularly in terms of income and social protection coverage &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;therefore, informal workers are more vulnerable to economic and social shocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document notes that the informal economy has become a growing concern in Bangladesh, and concludes that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;informal enterprises need more access to loans and technical training and modern machineries &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;comprehensive, detailed and up-to-date information about the informal sector and informal economy are needed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;such data is required to paint a clearer image of the state of the labour market, access to various social protection mechanisms, and the circumstances of the informal enterprises &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>This report gives a synthesized narrative of the studies undertaken in 15 communities in Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia The report summarizes the analyses of the projects carried out by 15 communities. The major success stories of the 15 communities is their ability to organize themselves for development activities. The collective action undertaken by the communities to decide, manage and organize their own affairs and guide external interventions brought about positive changes to improve conditions of living for the people in these communities. The empowerment of women has been a major factor in determining success. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, there has been much re-thinking on what aid is and how it should be delivered. This paper addresses these questions and related issues from a Pacific perspective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper argues that many aid programs are more about political and economic self-interest. In this context, it shows that China does not even attempt to say politics and aid are separate. Australia, in turn, is acting as the &amp;ldquo;big brother&amp;rdquo;, yet its aid is viewed as a substitute for the deeper engagement that can only come with a more mature relationship as development partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document elaborates the state and also draws on the findings of concerned publications to introduce the following points:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there is increasing dissatisfaction with aid programs in both donor and recipient countries, and a growing body of evidence suggests the need for substantial change&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this sense, intangible aid is a good example to prove that aid is not only ineffective, but even counter-productive and should be totally scrapped&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, there is little to suggest that the aid relationship has truly adapted to the shifting economic, political and technology landscapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, the author presents the following conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;changing the language of aid may help shift the relationship between donors and recipients to something closer to a real partnership &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it may also help with more transparent delivery and better ways of measuring the effectiveness of development support&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;absorptive capacity constraints are real, but should not be seen as an immutable barrier to growth, and development support should always be seen in human terms &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;identically, it is time to have a frank Pacific discussion on the general concerns relating to aid effectiveness, and understand the region&amp;rsquo;s landscape and recognise what works in that local context &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report builds on a vulnerability and adaptation assessment, which provided information on key threats to natural resources and the socio-political context of Lami Town, Fiji, and identified potential adaptation options to climate change. To further analyse these adaptation options, this synthesis report presents a cost-benefit assessment of four adaptation scenarios. These scenarios represent the spectrum of ecosystem-based and engineering adaptation options to reduce vulnerability to storms, which was identified by the Lami Town Council as the principal vulnerability concern. Examples of ecosystem-based options include replanting mangroves, reducing upland logging and reducing coral extraction; examples of policy and social options include regulating land tenure (informal settlements), relocating highly vulnerable households and flood warning systems and mapping. This report is intended to be used as the basis for development of a full adaptation plan for Lami Town. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The number of disasters per year has quadrupled over the past four decades in the South Asia Region (SAR), resulting in damages of over US$25 billion in the past five years alone. However, exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards and their consequential impacts are not yet at the forefront of development agendas. This report argues that the challenge lies in demonstrating results from investments that increase resilience to hazards. Only through a clear understanding of disaster risks can policymakers prioritise increasing their population’s resilience to these events. The report determines that disasters result from the combination of three key elements: i) natural hazards; ii) exposure (of people and property to these hazards); and iii) vulnerability (of the human and physical capital exposed) due to physical, social, economic, governance and environmental factors that increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of a natural hazard. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Income growth in rural Bhutan is a considerable challenge to further poverty reduction and economic development. Using a survey of rural Bhutanese households, this paper investigates the impacts of a vocational skills training program that was intended to diversify incomes outside of agriculture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors clarify that the rural skills development program in Bhutan was a short-term training program that trained the rural poor in practical construction skills with the intention of raising overall incomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings contain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the program had limited positive impacts along various economic and psychosocial dimensions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the program did raise incomes for trainees in non-competitive labour markets where trainees accounted for only a small percentage of the overall population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper notes that this highlights the need for program design to better assess the labour market and ensure that it does not become over saturated; otherwise, the training program may have little effect.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;having an explicit mechanism for trainees to enter the larger labour market through job placement services, and providing entrepreneurship support can further help to increase employment opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;this is particularly true in competitive labour markets where there are too many trainees in relation to the population &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;encouraging greater equality in the skill development process should be considered, but it may require providing more female-friendly training that has flexibility in training time and venues and focuses on other skill areas&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;refining the targeting of the program may help to better accelerate the speed at which it is possible to reduce poverty and vulnerability to poverty of the rural poor and increase equality in the development process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) explains how the Government of Mongolia’s Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) project is helping Mongolian herders cope with the harsh and unpredictable weather resulting from climate change. Index-based insurance programmes aim to make payouts based on an index of aggregated criteria, such as livestock losses over a geographic area, rather than households’ or businesses’ actual, individual losses. IBLI protects Mongolian families from significant livestock loss by providing financial security, while also encouraging herders to adopt practices that build their resilience to extreme weather events. In 2012 alone, herders bought 16,000 insurance policies. This brief demonstrates how an insurance programme such as IBLI can be used as part of a strategy to protect populations from climate-based risks. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Positive Health, Dignity and Prevention: A Policy Framework (January 2011) was developed by GNP+ and UNAIDS through consultation with networks of people living with HIV, civil society, governments, UN cosponsors and donors globally. The Policy Framework provides the broad concepts that represent the first steps towards operationalising Positive Health, Dignity and Prevention. The Policy Framework informs the development and implementation of operational guidelines that reflect linkages between a wide range of policies and programmes aimed at supporting and improving the health, dignity and prevention needs of people living with HIV. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study was conducted in tuberculosis patients in a rural district in Malawi to determine (i) the prevalence of malnutrition on admission and (ii) the association between malnutrition and early mortality, defined as death within the first four weeks of treatment. There were 1181 patients with tuberculosis whose overall rate of infection with HIV was 80%. 673 TB patients (57%) were malnourished on admission (BMI &amp;lt;18.5kg/m2). There were 259 patients (22%) with mild malnutrition (BMI 17.0-18.4kg/m2), 168 (14%) with moderate malnutrition (BMI16.0-16.9kg/m2) and 246 (21%) with severe malnutrition (BMI &amp;lt;15.9kg/m2). 95 patients (8%) died during the first four weeks. Significant risk factors for early mortality included increasing decrease of malnutrition, age &amp;gt; 35years, and HIV seropositivity. Among all the 1181 patients, 10.9% of the 414 patients with moderate to severe malnutrition died in the first four weeks compared with 6.5% of the 767 patients with normal to mild malnutrition. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The concept of digital library is not a new one, although it is only recently that digital library is gaining prominence all over the world. This article provides a holistic understanding of digital libraries including its present context and future directions. Various technical issues ingrained in the concept of digital library also has been analysed in the article. Issues like interoperability, information retrieval, property and access control and usability also has been discussed in detail. Although digital library is a technical phenomenon, it has wider social and economic implications. The article casts a critical glance at these implications as well. In the
end, ongoing international efforts in the arena of digital libraries also has been discussed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) at the United States (US)-based National Endowment for Democracy commissioned this study of training for journalists to cover elections in countries where media developers work to improve journalism. It explores different approaches to media training, how these can be strengthened, and what more needs to be done in order to cast elections as part of a critical on-going political process and to equip journalists to understand, monitor, and report about that. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh, a developing economy, contains trade deficit from her very inception. This paper makes an effort to understand the time series behavior of total export and total import of Bangladesh. Unit root tests recognize the existence of random walk in total export and total import time series. Johansen cointegration test reveals long-run equilibrium relationship between these two variables. Getting the existence of cointegration, the study attempts to find
causal relationship using error-correction mechanism. Test results unveil bidirectional long term causality and unidirectional short term causality between import and export of Bangladesh. Findings of the study corroborate that Bangladesh is not in violation of its international budget constraints. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper surveys forest carbon standards for their insight to relevant results-based payments for REDD+. The aim is to assess how different results-based initiatives deal with common Reference Level (RL) design problems in order to inform REDD+ negotiations and policymakers. RLs set a performance benchmark for mitigation activities by providing a reference point, or baseline, to which current and actual efforts can be compared throughout a pre-determined timeframe. The report is intended to serve as an overview of options for constructing RLs and enhance understanding of how their different forms and function will impact the overall design of REDD+ mechanisms. It concludes that although RLs in all the existing standards and initiatives share a core foundation (the idea of a performance benchmark or reference point for measuring results of mitigation efforts), they often have different nuances and functions depending on the context in which they apply and the purpose they serve. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in China. &lt;br /&gt;There is mounting evidence for a rapidly growing HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in China. Over one-third of new infections across the country are among MSM, with HIV prevalence estimates in some south-western cities approaching 17 percent. A large-scale survey in 2008-09 that spanned 61 cities found an average prevalence in medium and large cities of about 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men who have sex with men have been largely absent from national AIDS strategies until recent years. Sentinel surveillance began to include MSM in 2002 and a specific strategy to implement a comprehensive response to HIV among MSM began being implemented in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive experiences in Chengdu, a city with one of the largest HIV epidemics among MSM as well as some of the best-organised MSM community-based organisations, are serving as a model for other large cities in China. The outcome of its role in the &amp;lsquo;Men who have sex with men and transgender populations Multi-City Initiative&amp;rsquo; demonstrates the potential and importance of collaborative partnerships and networks of MSM in China&amp;rsquo;s HIV response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the more immediate concerns facing China in the response to HIV among MSM is the need to understand the relative effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions by ensuring that strong evaluation mechanisms are in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, MSM are recognised as a priority population in China&amp;rsquo;s national strategic plan and crucial work is underway to scale-up the response in key cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for China reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Trans people worldwide experience substantial health disparities and barriers to appropriate health care services. This report presents a number of case studies submitted by organisations from several countries, offering examples of efforts to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare presented to trans people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper notes that trans people are significantly more likely than the general population to be targeted for violence and harassment, to contract HIV, and to be at risk for mental health concerns.&amp;nbsp;Barriers to healthcare include discriminatory treatment by health care providers, a lack of providers who are trained to offer appropriate health care to trans people, and refusal by health systems to cover services for trans people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document introduces a set of themes that describe major areas of focus for trans health work:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;providing health care services not related to transition, including sexual and reproductive health services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;providing health care services related to transition, including hormone therapy, mental health services, and reconstructive surgeries &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;training health care providers to respect and respond appropriately to the health needs and concerns of trans people &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;conducting public education aimed at raising awareness of trans experiences and discrimination against trans people &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;advocating for policy change aimed at reforming the structures that impact trans people&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The following actions are recommended: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;governments have to protect transgender people from discrimination and create trans-friendly identity document policies &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;they have to invest in evidence-based and rights-based programs to achieve health equity for trans communities &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;human rights advocates have to integrate trans issues into human rights agendas by including trans community concerns and recognising gender diversity &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;trans communities have to form alliances to amplify trans voices, establishing activities promoting trans human rights in the language of health &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;funders have to support innovations in trans health advocacy and health care services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Unlike the widespread adoption of information and communications technology (ICT) in much of the economy, adoption of ICT in clinical care is limited. We examine how a number of not previously emphasized features of the health care and ICT markets interact and exacerbate each other to create barriers for adoption. We also examine how standards can address these barriers and the key issues to consider before investing in ICT. We conclude that the ICT market exhibits a number of unique features that may delay or completely prevent adoption, including low product differentiation, high switching costs, and lack of technical compatibility. These barriers are compounded by the many interlinked markets in health care, which substantially blunt the use of market forces to influence adoption. Patient heterogeneity also exacerbates the barriers by wide variation in needs and ability for using ICT, by high demands for interoperability, and by higher replacement costs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;font size="2"&gt;This paper analyses the challenges for designing Indian national policy to attract investment in wind and solar energy at a reasonable cost. It also examines the impact of national and state policies on various classes of renewable energy investors, as well as the overall relative costs or benefits of policies on the final cost of renewable energy projects. The paper particularly focuses on the cost and availability of equity and debt, respectively, and the consequent implications for Indian renewable and financial policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main sections of the paper address discuss:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The most pressing problem facing renewable energy financing in India is the high cost of debt.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;General Indian financial market conditions are the main cause of high interest rates for renewable energy.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The structure and regulation of the Indian power sector are significantly challenged, resulting in increased project risk and national policies that do not accurately reflect the realities of financial markets or state-level risks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Lessons learnt from, and policies developed by, developed economies may not be very useful due to differences in national financial markets that impact renewable energy policy design and effectiveness.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) is an especially promising example of bridging the financing gap (it plays a major role in almost every renewable project in the country, often by offering long-term loans at below-market rates), which deserves further study and consideration by Indian policymakers.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper aimed to explore the effect of incorporating blended learning with Facebook and peer assessment for English for Business Communication course for college students. A total of 111 students from a public technological university participated in this study. The participants were divided into three Facebook site groups. A mixed method consisting qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed to analyze the collected data, including the pre- and post-tests, qualitative data of peer assessment on Facebook sites, interview, a student self-efficacy scale, and a self-developed satisfaction survey questionnaire. The findings of this study indicate that incorporating Facebook in the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course can effectively assist college students in learning business communication English. Students can improve their professional knowledge not only from the in-class instruction but also through peer assessing on Facebook. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A study was conducted to explore the role of internet on higher education and research at two selected public universities in Bangladesh, which offer courses on Agricultural Sciences. One hundred and fifty eight teachers and 79 post-graduate students were interviewed based on questionnaires. It was found that 90.8% teachers had internet connectivity and they used internet on regular basis to search relevant websites and download the selected course contents. All the teachers agreed that adequate and reliable information on different topics of Agricultural Sciences can be obtained through internet, which can be used for academic and research purposes. Use of internet by the students is being gradually increased in public universities. The universities are expanding the internet facilities to increase services to the teaching and learning communities. Digitization of libraries and internet links between the public universities libraries are in progress. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study shows that 84(87.50%) patients had typhoid fever based on clinical examination and serological test results (widal test). It was observed that prevalence of enteric fever was high among the patients of school going age group (66.67%), habituated with unsafe drinking water (58.33%) and junk foods (72.92%). Statistical analysis showed that SSC level education in the parents who remain outside during the major part of the day for their livelihood had significant positive relationship with prevalence of typhoid fever. It was concluded that prevalence of typhoid fever was high among the children of school going age, who consume
unsafe drinking water and food from outside source. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The South Kivu (SK) province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has experienced recurrent wars for more than 15 years. This article explores the way local systems of governance and networking in SK have been affected by the civil war, and the ways in which local communities have tried to cope with the absence of the state. The paper indicates that life during the absence of state governance in SK was precarious, economic activities were disturbed and poverty became severe. However, the author points out that governance does not completely disappear when the state collapses, and multilayered, networked informal governance is much less of a threat to viable states than might be imagined. The author states that despite the end of violent confrontations, and the return of a more peaceful state in many areas, the situation in SK remains volatile. In this sense, the behaviour of many groups is determined by the fear that another cycle of war is in the making, and this threat makes all groups feel uneasy, fearful and suspicious of the another. 
Conclusions are as follows: 
• security will remain precarious and justice partial in SK (as long as unemployment remains severe); the army continues to be partially controlled; civil servants are left in miserable conditions, and militias control large areas 
• it is evident that when the state is incapable of assuring the security of its own population, it is difficult for social mechanisms and local institutions alone to substitute for the lack of a functioning state 
• correspondingly, people in SK want the UN stabilisation mission (MONUSCO) to be more committed and to improve its methods of protecting the local population and fighting against foreign interference. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Pacific islands are more than just strategic airfields and ports, but home to millions of people across one-third of the planet. The current paper highlights Pacific island views and concerns in terms of their future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper demonstrates that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the Asia Pacific region is now the focus of global economic and strategic competition &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific island nations would be well placed to work out what is in their long-term interest, and have leaders willing to help shape regional outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;regional powers may benefit from recalibrating relationships with Pacific states if they are to maintain influence&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific nations could benefit from China, the US and other powers having systems in place to better co-ordinate aid and security in the event of a crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Future expectations include: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific governments will continue to play off the great powers and open avenues of new opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;an optimistic view might see the potential for a friendly political understanding among Pacific islands &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in the big clash of ideas between progress forged by strong authoritarian rule or messy democracy, most Pacific nations will fall on the side of democracy&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a major superpower clash in the region is not inevitable; more likely will be periodic tribal clashes, but there is the danger of escalation if manipulated by outside forces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the author recommends regional powers to take more heed of Pacific concerns, and try to develop a better understanding of the complex political&amp;ndash;cultural conditions of the region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. This report aims to identify policy and other responses to impacts of environment events on human mobility within the Asia and Pacific region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report points that countries and populations of Asia and the Pacific will be affected in different ways, leading to various migration patterns and scenarios. Accordingly, conclusions include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;climate-induced migration needs to be addressed as part of the development agenda given the major implications of migration for the sustainable economic and social development of Asia and the Pacific &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;interventions are needed both to address the situation of those who have migrated, as well as those who remain in areas subject to environmental risk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;correspondingly, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the private sector can also play a large role in terms of tackling the challenge of climate-induced migration, yet an adequate framework is needed&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, it is important to recognise that migration, if properly managed, can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The paper states that international protection frameworks need to be strengthened, with specific arrangements developed for resettlement or relocation. Moreover, greater funding commitment and contributions of governments around the world will be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document also emphasises that more targeted, policy-relevant research is needed on the interaction between the environment and migration. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Fahr’s disease is a rare degenerative neurological disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal calcium deposits and associated cell loss in the areas of brain that control movement, including basal ganglia and cerebral cortex1-4. The condition is often referred to as idiopathic basal ganglia calciûcation, because
there is no apparent explanation for such calciûcation. Fahr’s disease was first noted by German neurologist Karl Theodor Fahr in 1930. The pathogenesis is not known, but may be secondary to impairment of the blood brain barrier or to a neuronal calcium phosphorus metabolism disorder1. According to reports in medical
literature, Fahr’s disease is often familial5,6. It is believed to have autosomal dominant inheritance but a few cases have been reported to have autosomal recessive inheritance and even some sporadic cases have been reported in literature. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this research was to investigate how the ‘level’ of ICT uptake amongst teachers and the ‘quality’ of ICT use in classrooms can be promoted by challenging teachers’ attitudes towards technology adoption. The issue of teachers ‘technology confidence’ and ICT lesson planning skills were tackled by providing training sessions that focused on encouraging them to use educational multimedia game resources for teaching and learning purposes. The results of
this study revealed a positive shift in teachers’ attitudes towards the received ICT training and positive attitudes towards the use of ICT in teaching. To encourage greater ICT use by teachers it is suggested that educational game playing workshops (that are aligned to curriculum outcomes) be considered as a form of sustainable in-service training. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Instrumental arguments linking inequality to environmental sustainability often suppose a negative relationship between inequality and social cohesion. While social cohesion is difficult to measure, there are measures of a narrower concept, social trust, and empirical studies have shown that social trust is negatively related to inequality. This paper tests whether at least part of the observed relationship may be explained by income level, rather than income distribution. The study used individual response data from the World Values Survey at the income decile level, finding evidence that income level is indeed important in explaining differences in levels of social trust, but it is insufficient to explain all of the dependence. In the sample used for the study, the authors find that both income level and income distribution help explain differences in social trust between countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study is a review of ICT applications in public healthcare system in India. It is not the number of employees that decides the quality of service but their efficiency. In public health, resources are few, time is extremely limited (with the threats of outbreak of epidemics like AIDS) and results have to be achieved in a limited time frame. Therefore, there is need for more and better ICT tools. Any additional aid makes tasks easy and efficient. India spends 85% of the government budget on personnel. Employment of additional personnel or creation of one department or a post will not automatically ensure achievement of the set objectives in improving the health status of women and children. Public health is a proactive and developmental function. The personnel need implements, tools, technologies, and training to effectively discharge their duties. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bombay blood group is the rarest blood group in the world. It is a blood group which shows absence of A,B,H antigens on red cells and presence of anti- A, anti-B and potent wide thermal range anti-H antibodies in serum reacting with all O blood group1. Dr. Y.M. Bhende first discovered Bombay blood group in 1952 at Bombay in India now known as Mumbai.This is the reason why this blood group got the name Bombay blood group. No specific statistics of people with Bombay blood group in Bangladesh is available. The first person with Bombay blood group was identified in Bangladesh. in Narayangonj. Till now four people of Bombay blood group found in Bangladesh. Among them three are sisters of same family12.So the transfusion centers should have the means and the thought to test for Bombay group. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Education is one of the main keys to economic development and improvements in human welfare. As global competition grows sharper, education becomes an important source of competitive advantage and appears to be one of the key determinants of standardization of life. Information and communication technology (ICT) is playing a central role in the development of modern economies and societies. As the world is going through the
technological revolution, adoption of new technologies in the education system is the most important. This has profound implications for education, both because ICT can facilitate new forms of learning and because it has become important for young people to master ICT in preparation for adult life. This study investigates current status of ICT in educational institutions and educational organization related activities and provides comprehensive recommendations to build a digital society in Bangladesh in the near future. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The incidence of diarrhoea has declined over time in Bangladesh but still it persists as a major cause of infant mortality, morbidity and acute child malnutrition. Much of the public policy thinking in the past was guided by public investment in providing improved access to safe water. While this measure has paid off, the paper provides evidence that the relevance of water as a tool for fighting diarrhoea may have changed over time. Its changing role now needs to be seen in the broader context of combined access with other inputs such as improved sanitation. The paper uses the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data and the propensity score matching technique to suggest that only combined access to improved water and sanitation can lead to reduced incidence of diarrhoea among children in contrast to their isolated use. Mere accesses to safe water, or for that matter, access to sanitation do not have any statistically significant impact on the incidence of childhood diarrhoea. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Air particulate matter samples were collected using Air Metrics samplers from 11 - 17 January and 19 - 27 January, 2012 at Amin Bazar and Farm Gate sites, respectively. The sampling time was 
from 8 a.m. - 4 p.m. Three samplers were used of which two samplers were for PM2.5 samples, using Teflon and quartz filters and the others for PM10 samples using Teflon filter. Organic and elemental carbons (OC and EC) were measured in PM2.5 samples at both sites. It has been found that the EC concentration at Amin Bazar is higher than in Farm Gate. The contribution of EC may 
come from diesel, gasoline and coal/wood combustions in the Amin Bazar site. The present OC/EC data were compared with the previous data. It was found that the concentration of EC became higher than those in the previous year. During last couple of years, Government implemented different policies specially in case of motor vehicles to improve the air quality. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An experiment was carried out at the Horticulture Farm, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh to study the effect of nitrogen and plant spacing on the growth and yield of potato. Four different nitrogen levels significantly influenced plant height, foliage coverage, number of main stem per hill, fresh weight of haulm per hill, number of tubers per hill, weight of tubers per hill, yield of tubers and seed tubers per hectare. Yield of tubers per hectare was significantly and positively correlated with plant height, foliage coverage, and number of stems per hill, fresh weight of haulm per hill, number of tubers per hill and weight of tubers per hill. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report draws lessons on finance options and barriers related to project activities from the forest sector. It investigates the economics of implementing forest and REDD+ projects through a number of case studies from Africa, Latin America and Asia. Key conclusions include: public-private partnerships offer the most successful means to attracting investment and achieving sound project management; national REDD+ programmes offer the greatest potential to scale up investment in REDD+; forest carbon projects still do not represent attractive investment options for the private sector when compared to standard carbon projects; and financial risk is a major barrier to scaling up from forest carbon projects to REDD+ national strategies. The report hopes to advise policymakers, financial sector stakeholders and project developers on how to structure and implement REDD+ initiatives and strategies, especially in relation to attracting private and/or public investments. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Africa faces a double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. While infectious diseases still account for at least 69% of deaths in the continent, age specific mortality rates from chronic diseases as a whole are actually higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in virtually all regions of the world, in both men and women. Over the next ten years, the continent is projected to experience the largest increase in death rates from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes. This editorial reviews eight original papers which offer new empirical evidence and comprehensive reviews on diabetes in Tanzania, sickle cell disease in Nigeria, chronic mental illness in rural Ghana, HIV/AIDS care-giving among children in Kenya and chronic disease interventions in Ghana and Cameroon. There is an urgent need for primary and secondary interventions and for African health policy makers and government to prioritize the development and implementation of chronic disease policies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Nigeria is a significant producer of crude oil. Over the years, various governments in Nigeria have been subsidising the pump price of crude oil, mainly arguing that this helps to improve welfare of the countryâ€™s citizens. However, this paper argues that this might need to change considering the effects exploration of crude oil has on increasing carbon dioxide emissions. The study aims to document the implications climate change has on Nigeriaâ€™s crude oil market (and the economy at large) and conceptualise fuel subsidy removal as a climate change mitigation strategy for Nigeria. It concludes that while fuel subsidy removal policy (in the short term) would have welfare implications, in the long run, the policy would bring about greener growth and enhance sustainable development. It also notes that on the adjustment of consumption patterns, afforestation policies (especially in the rural areas) are required to avoid a rapid switch to tree felling for energy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change poses a serious risk to food security and agriculture in China. Agriculture is of critical importance to China, because 54 per cent of the country&amp;rsquo;s population lives in rural areas. This policy brief outlines the key research highlights to date on the impacts of climate change on agriculture. This work is part of the ongoing research by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science (CAAS) for the Adapting to Climate Change in China (ACCC) project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key findings:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Average temperature in China is increasing at a slightly faster rate than the global average, leading to a lengthening of the growing season which affects current cropping systems and management practices.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Droughts cause the largest direct economic losses in China.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wheat, rice and maize yields seem to be decreasing in the southern parts of China, where crops are already grown close to their temperature tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improved understanding of climate change impacts on agriculture in China could improve the design of adaptation strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is potential to increase food production with the right strategies and technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study aimed at exploring the factors determining mothers’ choices of appropriate child health and nutrition practices in the Gambia. Eight focus-group discussions (FGDs) were held with 63 women whose children had been seen at the Keneba MRC Clinic within the 12 months preceding the study. The FGDs were analyzed using a thematic framework. Gender inequality, presence or absence of support networks, alternative explanatory models of malnutrition, and poverty were identified as the main factors that would determine the ability of a mother to practice what she knows about child health and nutrition. The findings highlight the need to consider the broader social, cultural and economic factors, including the value of involving men in childcare when designing nutritional interventions &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper analyses the connections between climate change impacts, ecosystem degradation and increased risk of climate-related disasters. It defines the central role of ecosystem management in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and assesses the challenges for enhanced ecosystem management for climate change adaptation and DRR. Given the increasing importance of ecosystem services and management in climate change adaptation and DRR, the paper concludes that political commitment at the highest level is urgently needed if ecosystem management is to have the adequate weight it deserves in the post-2012 climate change agreement. The paper also recommends the allocation of further resources for integrating ecosystem management into climate change and DRR portfolios, including within national policy-setting, capacity building, planning and practices, particularly in developing countries vulnerable to climate change impacts and climate-related disasters. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study investigates specific information regarding the challenges of globalization faced by Bangladesh and how it should 
prepare itself to coup with the challenges. The result suggest that Bangladesh is not in comfort in coping with the winds of 
globalization, as it has less access to and use of different opportunities living at the margin in the hierarchies of global order with low technological base, poor infrastructures and governance in most arenas. The study also suggest that Bangladesh needs to be engaged with all its development partners in a healthy and constructive process of interaction on stabilization, reform programme and other critical issues like national capacity building, competitiveness, political stability, cross border terrorism, arms and drug trafficking, climate change and environmental degradation. The policy implication is that various economic policy orientation and utilization of resources should be as such that they can supplement economic growth in &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Today is the world of Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Google, Yahoo, I-pods, I- pads. Gadgets reign supreme even in a developing country like Bangladesh (e.g. cell phones) and so technology is fused in every part of our lives, in fact, â€œtechnology is no longer a tool to create an alternative environment- it is THE environmentâ€ (Gupta, 2010: 68). Academic institutions are, therefore, expected to prepare students for a technological era that awaits them. As an inevitable consequence, there is an expectation from administrators and students alike that a teacher will use technology to sophisticate teaching.This article is a brief overview of technologies and tools considered necessary for the language teacher of today especially in the context of Bangladesh. It also tries to summarize dominant emerging trends in the field of technology enhanced language learning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Cervical cancer remains a threat which is second only to breast cancer in overall disease burden for women throughout the world. Organized screening with Pap cytology has made substantial reductions in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in recent years. Establishment of genital human papillomaviruses (HPVs) as the etiological agent and invention of HPV vaccines now provide a great opportunity which could be useful in saving millions of lives in future. Initial Phase I, II and early phase III trials have shown promising results of this vaccine. This review article therefore is aimed to explore different aspects of this vaccine as well as to develop awareness among health professionals of different disciplines. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

This report identifies global climate finance flows of US$364 billion in 2011. According to the report, the private sector provided the majority of finance, mostly from developed countries. The public sector acted as a catalyst for private investment by providing incentives and concessional loans, as well as bilateral aid to developing countries. Public and private intermediaries, especially national development banks and commercial banks, played an important role in channelling and raising climate finance. The majority of funding captured by the report relates to mitigation activities. Emerging economies such as China, Brazil, and India received one-third of mitigation-directed climate finance; notably, most of these investments were raised domestically and invested in pursuit of development mandates. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has immense prospect for exporting vegetables to the world market and it has also produced high quality exportable fresh vegetable. Although the share of export earning in vegetables increasing day by day but export is constrained by several issues. Thus the present study was undertaken to determine the value addition, cost and return of vegetables production and export at different levels and also suggest some policy implication for improving the present system. The study was based on both primary and secondary data. The sample included vegetables producer, suppliers, and exporters. Vegetable producers and suppliers were selected from Ulokhola of Kaligonj Upazila and exporters were selected from Dhaka city (Motijheel, Kakrail, Shantinagar, Khilgaon, and Sham Bazar).Among all the cost items, airfreight charge was the highest. It was revealed from the study that bitter gourd cultivation is more profitable and BCR is also highest (3.27) and UK market was more profitable. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This working paper presents a landscape assessment of independent efforts to track the adoption, implementation and impact of climate change policies around the world. It provides guidance for researchers, funders and governments on filling information gaps regarding climate change policy. The paper observes that the climate policy tracking community has developed a diverse portfolio of methodologies and frameworks to address a wide range of policy tracking needs. Nevertheless, information about climate policies remains patchy, particularly in regard to monitoring of policy implementation and policies under development. The report includes the following recommendations: deepen monitoring and evaluation of policy implementation and policies under development; strengthen climate policy tracking at the country level, while maintaining internationally focused efforts; enhance coordination and collaboration among climate policy tracking practitioner; and scope out emerging issues. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) have released a new publication series intending to document and circulate good practices, share progress, stimulate discussion, and inform priority interventions and advocacy efforts to address the rising HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Asia. The MSM Country Snapshots were initiated in recognition of the difficulty of accessing up-to-date country-level information on MSM and HIV. Most importantly, they allow for convenient access to key findings for anyone with limited access to academic journals or knowledge of sources for biological and behavioral surveillance data. The documents synthesize key findings at time of publication that span four areas of strategic information: epidemiological, behavioral, programmatic and legal. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Attempts to explain the astonishing differences in agricultural productivity around the world typically focus on farm size, farmer risk aversion, and credit constraints, with an emphasis on how they might serve to limit technology adoption. This paper takes a different tack: can managerial practices explain this variation in productivity? A randomized evaluation of the introduction of a mobile-phone based agricultural consulting service, â€Avaaj Otalo (AO)â€ to cotton farmers in Gujarat, India, reveals the following. Demand for agricultural advice is high, with more than half of farmers calling AO in the first seven months. Farmers offered the service turn less often to other farmers and input sellers for agricultural advice. Management practices change as well: we observe an increase in the adoption of more effective pesticides, and reduced expenditure on less effective and hazardous pesticides. Treated farmers also sow a significantly larger quantity of cumin, lucrative but risky crop. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report examines the history, structure and monitoring mechanisms of REDD+ to better understand how it impacts upon, and interacts with, Community Forest Management (CFM). It presents case studies of CFM and REDD+ governance from Bangladesh, Indonesia and India, and concludes with some lessons learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDD+ is an example of multilevel governance that uses a variety of institutional structures and processes aimed at promoting sustainable management of forests, including financial incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. At the national level, countries have their own systems of governance, often jointly managed by multiple interests, including CFM. Having given an overview of REDD+ itself, the paper explores how REDD+ influences and reacts to local circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case studies feature different aspects of CFM and REDD+ governance. The paper highlights the emerging role of CFM in reducing carbon emissions in Bangladesh, presents lessons from the implementation of a public/private partnership in Indonesia and explores indigenous carbon management practices in India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions drawn from the case studies on challenges and implications for REDD+ governance include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The role of forest stocks in international regimes requires clarification; forest stocks must be managed in ways that incentivise communities and governments to avoid deforestation and degradation, whilst remaining sensitive to the needs of forest-dependent communities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Local government capacity must be sufficiently strengthened so as to provide support in connecting local and global governance. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is a need to link carbon management with local practices and economic activities; community forums should be established to allow all stakeholders to collaborate and explore strategies that harness local opportunities for income diversification.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Issues of land tenure and carbon rights must be clarified and strengthened to provide lasting security to forest-dependent communities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Monitoring, reporting and verifying the participation of all stakeholders requires greater effort and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Protocols are required for resolving ecological problems and dispute settlements; interaction should be more informal and decisions made by consensus rather than majority rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This evaluation report looks at the Humqadam programme, a set of interventions with men and boys in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The programme grew out of the organisation Rozan&amp;rsquo;s work to include men as partners in violence prevention. Activities involved community sessions with around 100 men and boys, interactive community theatres, a Stop Rape campaign and cross gender discussion forums. Evaluation of the programme was based on a quantitative tool measuring attitudinal statements and in depth qualitative interviews with participants. When compared to baseline data, the evaluation data showed positive shifts in attitudes, especially around understandings of violence and the rights of women not to tolerate it. There was also change in recognising women&amp;rsquo;s potential and opportunities, in decision making and employment, for example. But attitudes about men&amp;rsquo;s role as breadwinners and family leaders were more difficult to shift. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report concludes with some practical lessons learnt from the programme evaluation. These include the importance of nurturing new insights through sustained opportunities for activism and sharing of experiences, and the usefulness of working with young women in the community, involving them in interactive cross gender discussion with young men. One important point made is that masculinities are fragile, multiple and constructed; working with men and boys can bring, for them, an uncomfortable awareness of unequal power and privilege, but offers an important opportunity to challenge and contest the values and norms that can lead to violence against women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study was a descriptive prospective trial aimed to describe the nutritional status and impact of current nutrition intervention strategies on weight changes in adult HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Results showed that patients from Kuruman had a greater incidence of underweight compared to other towns, with a median BMI of 17.9kg/sqmeter. Of the 87 patients assessed during the final week, 49.4% experienced weight gain and 40.2% lost weight. 18(20.7%) patients gained more than 5% of their baseline weight. 22 patients who presented with BMI &amp;lt; 18.5kg/sqmeter at baseline had a median weight gain of 1.13kg during the intervention period, while the group with BMI &amp;gt; 18.5kg/sq meter presented with no change in median weight.

    <dcterms:abstract>Empirical studies on the impact of women’s paid jobs on their empowerment and welfare in Bangladesh are mostly confined to the garment workers. Besides, these studies seldom control for non-working women and/or apply any statistical techniques to control for the effects of other pertinent determinants of women’s empowerment and welfare. This study overcomes these drawbacks and presents alternative assessments of the link between women’s workforce participation and empowerment on the basis of survey
data from the two largest cities in Bangladesh. While the generic assessment indicates that women’s paid jobs have positive implications for women’s participation in decisions on fertility, children’s education and health care as well as their possession and control of resources, the econometric assessment negates most of these observations. Women’s education, on the other hand, appears to be more important than their participation in the labour force. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Gaining access to land with mineral and hydrocarbon resources can present a significant challenge. Experiences from Latin America show that direct land expropriation has been abandoned in favour of social licence, meaning securing community or individual agreement about the use of land for extractive activities. This Brief describes the key factors that have enabled this transformation, and provides examples to illustrate the main social licence strategies in use in Latin America. Finally, the Brief identifies key lessons from policy and practice that will be useful for other regions facing similar challenges. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Public procurement is public policy tool, translating development finance into particular economic and social outcomes. However, it has also been globally identified as fountain head of corruption in the public service.

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines the relationship between climate and the prevalence of malaria in Warri metropolis, Nigeria. Collected climate data was analysed against malaria patient records from three hospitals for a period of twenty years (1990-2009) using a multiple regression approach. The study shows that both rainfall and temperature in Warri metropolis have increased over the past hundred years (1907-2009) by 122.82 mm and 1.3 degrees Celsius. The study highlights the relationship between malaria and climate, and shows that malaria prevalence in Warri metropolis and its environs is significantly dependent on rainfall, relative humidity and temperature. An increase in temperature and relative humidity is likely to increase the number of malaria cases, and the study, therefore, recommends that any policy aimed at reducing the prevalence of malaria must include efforts to reduce the number of mosquitoes through the improvement of the environment, which entails climate change mitigation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In a bid to understand the lesson of ethics in the existing primary education according to government approved syllabus in Bangladesh, a survey was carried out in Dhaka and Kushtia for students studying at class 1 to class V, teachers and guardians. It
has found that majority students are aware of ‘right and wrong’. Their source of learning are parents as mostly found, followed by teachers and both. Majority of guardians think text books contain ethical knowledge and they are insufficient. All the teachers found the textbooks contain ethical knowledge and education but only one forth of them found those as insufficient. Stories carry ethical lesson but no individual lesson/chapter was found to be available in any books.The paper has tried to understand the existing syllabus in government run primary schools up to class V through interviewing students, teachers and guardians so that the level of lessons taught, and the need to learn the ethical knowledge can be assessed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change is one of the most important issues to tackle this generation and possibly any generation in history. Bangladesh is a very low energy consuming country, it is pursuing a low carbon growth path, while building its resilience to climate change and reducing the risk of climate change, which represents national development. However, Bangladesh is one of the top 10 nations that are mostly vulnerable to climate change and by the end of the century, Bangladesh may be set to disappear under the waves. The government and non-governmental organizations have a key role to play. This study was carried out by employing a general review of literature on climate change, focusing on its effects in Bangladesh, and the results of specific research recently conducted by the author. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh is afflicted by a multitude of natural hazards. In an average year, roughly 10 million Bangladeshi citizens are affected by one or more such hazards and their frequency and severity is projected to increase as a result of climate change. This ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network notes that the impacts of these disasters are exacerbated by the fact that almost one third of the nation’s population lives below the poverty line and has little capacity to adapt. The brief illustrates how Bangladesh has developed a comprehensive disaster management programme, which takes a proactive approach to addressing disasters, shifting the emphasis away from relief and rehabilitation towards risk reduction. It aims to accomplish this by fostering a holistic, multi-hazard approach to reduce the nation’s risk and vulnerability to a variety of human-induced and natural hazards. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper attempts to provide deeper insight into the e-government landscape in Asian region. First, the paper highlights the state of e-governance in Asia – regional competiveness and intra-regional performance. Second, it determines the structure of the existing e-governance divide in the region from two different perspectives, at sub-regional and country levels. Third, the paper investigates the possible impact of e-governance on the quality of governance in terms of: (i) voice and accountability and (ii) government effectiveness in the region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The causal relationship between money and income remains a contentious and lively issue in the literature. Even though the literature on this issue is voluminous, however, for Bangladesh it is quite nascent. A few earlier studies suffer from methodological deficiency as they did not take into consider the time series properties of the variables. The objective of this paper is to look on the causality between money and income in Bangladesh. The paper differs from the earlier ones regarding data used and econometric techniques applied. The main contribution of the paper is to address the issue of short run dynamics of the money income relationship within a long run relationship. The empirical results show that money supply and income are cointegrated, implying that there is stable long run relationship between them. The estimated error correction model shows that there is bidirectional causality between money and income. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Using 2005 and 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)data, the paper examines income inequality and poverty in Bangladesh with focus on their spatial dimensions. As disparity among administrative divisions is small, such inequalities, especially in the urban areas, need policy attention. As education appears to play an important role in increasing urban inequality, raising the level of general education is essential. Similarly, wages
and salaries contribute to mitigating inequality which points to expanding opportunities for earning formal incomes. Though the effects are likely to be small, transfer programmes may be expanded to raise incomes among the poorest. In addition to raising general educational level, it is necessary to provide primary education throughout the country in order to mitigate poverty. It is imperative to raise agricultural productivity in both rural and
urban sectors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The adipocyte derived hormone, leptin has cytokine-like function and may mediate the effects of starvation on immunity. This study aims to describe the in vivo relation of leptin and immune function in children. Fasting plasma leptin concentrations, immune function, and mucosal function were measured in a cohort of 472 moderately malnourished rural Gambian children. Leptin concentrations correlated with body fat assessed by mid upper arm circumference or BMI for age z scores, and were low compared to well-nourished European norms. No detectable relations were found between leptin concentrations and any of the measures of immune or mucosal function. This result confirms that leptin acts as a peripheral signal of energy restriction, but do not support an association between fasting plasma leptin levels and immune function in children of this age. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A study was carried out to observe the effect of temperature on the shelf life of ripe mangoes. The mangoes were washed properly with tap water and kept at room temperature, covered with jute bag, mustard oil, in the refrigerator and freezer. The organoleptic observation showed that the color, texture and flavor of the frozen samples were moderated acceptable for maximum shelf life. For maximum shelf life the ripe mango should be stored under freezing temperature. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Nigeria has made little progress towards reducing child mortality – Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4. According to the UN mortality estimates, Nigeria has achieved only an average of 1.2% reduction in under-five mortality per year since 1990. To meet MDG 4, Nigeria will need to achieve an annual reduction rate of 10% from now until 2015 This report presents a summary of some key findings on neonatal and under-five mortality in Nigeria. Implementable priority actions before pregnancy, during pregnancy and for postnatal care are also proposed in order to meet the MDG goal 4 by 2015. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) stimulate domestic demand through job creation, innovation, and competition; however, in Asia, the reality is that SMEs have poor access to finance. This working paper discusses a new regime of SME finance amid an era of global imbalances, with empirical analyses of bank financing for SMEs in Asian countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author highlights that adequate access to finance is crucial for SMEs to survive and eventually grow beyond their SME status. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions encompass:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;prioritising SME development is critical for promoting inclusive economic growth in most economies in Asia &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SMEs comprise a variety of firms in terms of sector, scale, and management style; therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach to SME financing would be useless &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;improving financial access for SMEs is expected to bring many benefits, including enhancing production quality and increasing new business opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it would also stimulate investment and consumption at the national level, and mobilise excess corporate savings &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, including SMEs at all stages of the formal financial system is beneficial for rebalancing the global economy &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;still, the relationship between SME promotion and finance is like the wheels of a car: if all components are not spinning in synchronisation, a balanced, sustainable, and resilient Asia will not be realised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is necessary to establish organic coordination among regulations, policies, and the elaboration of both financing and supporting infrastructure involving all players in this field - a holistic approach to financial inclusion strategies is needed &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the improvement of lending efficiency and the diversification of financing modalities can help expand SMEs&amp;rsquo; access to finance, particularly given the largely bank-centered financial system in Asia &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores the potential of ICTs to enhance local economic and social development, improve relations between governments and citizens and foster overall capacity-building in developing countries, based on experiences of UNESCO’s project “ICTs as Tools for Improving Local Governance” and other relevant initiatives. Chapter I and II reflect theoretical foundations of e-governance and provide evidence of its use to foster accountability and efficiency of governments in developing countries. Methodology is described in chapter III. Experiences from UNESCO’s project “ICTs as Tools for Improving Local Governance” are highlighted in chapter IV. The project focused on the use of ICTs to foster transparent and efficient local governance by providing training, capacity- building and regional collaboration in the African, Caribbean and Latin American regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the innovative adaptive measures used by farmers in northern Nigeria to respond to the effects of climate change. Quantitative and qualitative approaches (rapid rural appraisal, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews) were used to gather information from 500 farmers. The findings indicate that 84 per cent and 79 per cent of the farmers were aware and knowledgeable of climate change issues, respectively, while 81 per cent of them noted that they had experienced climate change incidences. The paper highlights adaptive measures used by the farmers in northern Nigeria, including: changes in planting and harvesting dates, multiple cropping, intensive manure application, shift to different sites and use of wetland/river valley (fadama) for farming. The study concludes that there is a need for the government to make concrete efforts to enact appropriate policies on climate change adaptation and assist local farmers to improve their resilience. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper concentrates on how ICT can affect the lives of rural people in the developing world. The total rural population of the developing world is about 3.5 billion, with their average per capita income being no more than $ 200 per year. India, with 700 million rural people located in 600,000 villages, is a reflection of the developing world. The key issue that is addressed in the paper is whether technology can bring about a difference in the lives of people who earn less than half a dollar a day. Can health and education be made available to them? Can they afford the Internet? And ultimately, can it significantly enhance their livelihoods and income? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document contains the latest developments in ICT research and innovation, reflects the way ICT currently helps in addressing and solving societal challenges: a powerful mix of continuity and new initiatives that leads to concrete results through multidisciplinary solutions.
Thanks to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), solutions that are or will soon become reality will make it possible to provide everyone, regardless of their location, with better and personalised healthcare, whilst at the same time delivering cost savings for patients and society at large. Citizens and business interactions with public authorities will be faster and more effective, including across the borders. For our ageing population, a greater number of people will be able to live safely and independently. ICT will also help tackling environmental issues, such as energy efficiency and greener transport, in the perspective of a sustainable growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Kidney disease is one of the world's major public health problems and the prevalence of kidney failure is rising day by day. The structure and function of the kidney changes with advancing age. This study is to find out the histological architecture of kidney in Bangladeshi people related to age. The study was descriptive type of cross-sectional study carried out in the Department of Anatomy, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, from July 2006 to June 2007.For this study 30 pairs of postmortem human kidneys of age ranging from 3 years to 60 years were selected. The kidneys were collected from dead bodies autopsied in the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College.The collected sample was divided into three age groups. They are as follows, group A (3-20 years), group B (21-40 years) and group C (41-60 years). All the samples were examined histologically by staining with Haematoxylin and Eosin stain. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper was initially prepared as a discussion document at the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Tunis, November 2005. This paper discusses the information which is available from existing international school surveys with a view to identifying the most commonly used indicators on ICT use in formal education, which will provide the most comparable data to monitor the action plan proposed at the end of the second phase of the World Summit. Using existing surveys will maximise comparability and reliability of results while minimising the data collection burden on countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The object of this report is to explain the problems facing rural access to ICT and to make recommendations to improve access. Over three months, from September to December 2004, our team visited nine ICT projects and met their stakeholders. These ranged from ‘outsiders’ such as state-level officials who want to use ICT to provide social services, commercial firms that supply telecommunications services, district level revenue collectors and NGOs to village residents and admistrators who are consumers, intermediaries, and producers of ICT services. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>this article is mostly about mobile phone access and use, as this is the dominant story of the last decade for people in the
bottom or base of the pyramid. This is not to deny the importance of broadband, Internet connection, or computers and devices with computing power much greater than that of mobiles. Initiatives in telecenter development and “one laptop per child,” for example, are important in bringing more complex services to poor people, and have had mixed success and reviews. Unlike mobile phone penetration, these technologies have been driven more by public and nongovernmental organizations than by market supply and demand. What is clear is the importance of increasing mobile phone access and
mobile-based services prior to the proliferation of broadband in the BoP, no matter which forms that eventually takes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Many coastal areas at risk from sea level rise and the increased intensity of extreme weather events. Simultaneously, these areas are also experiencing significant socio-economic challenges associated with rural-urban transitions, population growth and increased consumption resulting from improving gross regional product. Recognition that climate change mitigation efforts will be insufficient to ensure community resilience has prompted an increased focus on the facilitation of adaptive responses. This paper explores the viability of proposed adaptation pathways in Soc Trang province, Vietnam, which is an area of the Mekong Delta experiencing cumulative pressures on coastal livelihoods. The study finds that emphasising sustainable livelihoods is less likely to lead to maladaptation, because stakeholders consciously seek to avoid optimising particular system elements at the expense of others and thus engage in broader decision-making frameworks supportive of social-ecological resilience. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The prerogative of mercy to persons convicted of criminal offences is an ancient concept and this power traditionally was vested in heads of states. Every civilized country in its constitution or in its laws provides for a power to grant pardon or remission of sentences, though the means or conditions of grant of pardon vary from country to country. It is imperative that this pardoning power should be exercised only to prevent miscarriage of justice. The object of conferring this judicial power on the President is to correct possible judicial errors, as no human system of judicial administration can be free from imperfections. Exercise of the presidential power to grant clemency over the last couple of years has led to a perception of the misuse and abuse of such extraordinary constitutional authority. The way of exercising presidential clemency for the benefit of the ruling party men also appears to be a severe blow to the rule of law in Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;This report describes the status of agricultural aid and cooperation programmes by Brazil and China in Zimbabwe from three perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specification for each programme: the actors (governmental or otherwise) and their roles in the provision of such aid. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nature of the aid and cooperation programmes: i.e. operational instruments used (e.g. financial support, technical cooperation, food aid, government-to-government, private sector driven), volumes pledged/disbursed, and a description of the status with specific projects and programmes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An analysis of the relevance and impacts (current and foreseen) of the cooperation programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albeit preliminary at this stage, the scope for the cooperation programmes to accomplish intended outcomes is discussed throughout the ensuing sections, with reference made to the actors and interests being served, and any networks being formed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This working paper seeks to offer practical guidance on how to put into operation the concepts outlined in the International Institute for Environment and Development&amp;rsquo;s (IIED) Climate Change Working Paper No. 1. It presents the Tracking Adaptation and Measuring Development (TAMD) twin-track framework, which aims to be versatile enough to be used at any scale and tailored to specific contexts. It differs from other assessment frameworks by emphasising the need to incorporate changing climate risks in the assessment of development interventions, so that effective interventions are not obscured by changing and increasing risk and vulnerability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Track one assesses climate risk management interventions, whilst track two concerns how these interventions influence development and adaptation outcomes through various processes. TAMD can evaluate interventions outputs, short-terms outcomes and long-term impacts within these two tracks, at scales ranging from supranational to the local level. In doing so, it explores how adaptation interventions both contribute to better climate risk management and help keep development outcomes on course in changing climate conditions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper discusses the necessity and methodology of baseline data, suggests measurement indicators and develops theories of change and causal narrative that can robustly attribute outcomes and long-term impacts to interventions. TAMD seeks to evaluate adaptation through: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;using indicators of the extent and quality of climate risk management &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;assessing how climate risk management benefits vulnerable people using standard indicators to show whether development is &amp;lsquo;on track&amp;rsquo; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;employing indicators to reveal systemic reductions in vulnerability, increased resilience and enhanced adaptive capacity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is suggested that the indicators outlined are partly illustrative; they will need to be adjusted toward different scales and contexts. There is also a need for further exploration on the question of attribution and the construction of baselines. An annex provides template scorecards for track one categorical indicators. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This policy report examines relations between Ghana and the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC), which established official diplomatic ties in 1960. On the second leg of Premier Wen Jiabao&amp;rsquo;s seven-nation tour of Africa in June 2007, China and Ghana issued a joint communiqu&amp;eacute; on strengthening cooperation in trade, infrastructure, telecommunications, education, health and culture. The Chinese premier&amp;rsquo;s visit resulted in the signing of six agreements, including a $66 million loan agreement to expand and upgrade Ghana&amp;rsquo;s telecommunications network. Over the decades, Ghana has provided critical diplomatic support to China, while China has reciprocated with material support for development. This report analyses China&amp;rsquo;s development assistance to Ghana, China&amp;rsquo;s companies and FDI in Ghana&amp;rsquo;s extractive and non-extractive sectors, Chinese TNCs in Ghana, and governance issues. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in the Philippines. The Philippines has among the lowest rates of HIV transmission in the region, with an estimated total of just over 10,514 infections between 1984 and August 2012. Its HIV epidemic is increasingly concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM) and other key affected populations, with tremendous variation across sub-populations and location. Some attribute the relatively slow spread of HIV in the Philippines to its complex geography and isolation from the larger regional epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing concern of an emerging epidemic among Filipino MSM. Sexual transmission between males has been the predominant mode of transmission since 2007. Serologic surveillance over the last few years indicates that HIV incidence among females is reaching a plateau but appears to be growing rapidly among males. Approximately six out of ten people living with HIV contracted the virus through sexual transmission between men. In 2011, about eight out of ten new infections were among MSM. HIV diagnoses have increased three-fold between 2003 and 2008, a fact that, in the context of other mounting evidence, suggests a forthcoming expansion of the HIV epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central advisory, planning, and policy-making body of the government is known as the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC). It was established in 1992 to act as a multi-sectoral advisory body to the President on policy related to HIV. However, it remained crippled by a small budget until the Philippines Government enacted the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998. Among the things it called for were a comprehensive nationwide HIV and AIDS educational and information campaign; greater recognition of the human rights of persons affected by HIV; and heightened involvement of local governments to provide community-based HIV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for MSM and TG Populations 2012-2016, which is anchored on the 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan for 2011 to 2016, represents the most ambitious effort yet to combat HIV in the Philippines. It calls for policies and programmes informed by serologic surveillance data, a broader range of actors, and the integration of stigma reduction measures across the spectrum of HIV and AIDS services. There is indeed a precedent for a late-stage resurgence of HIV transmission in countries with historically low and stable HIV prevalence. But there is also little doubt that the epidemic&amp;rsquo;s future toll will depend in large part on how quickly and comprehensively the Philippines responds to rising HIV risk among men who have sex with men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for the Philippines reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This publication contains a collection of examples of “ICT in Teacher Education” programmes from the Asia-Pacif ic region. While these programmes may not always have been successful and are notnecessarily examples of “best practice”, an examination of such programmes offers insights into the process of educating teachers to integrate ICT into teaching and the process of utilizing ICT tools for training teachers. In addition, these programmes provide information about the issues that are often faced in ICT-enhanced teacher education in the region and the lessons that have been learned through past experience. This information will be useful to education planners, teachers, educators and researchers, particularly those in the Asia-Pacif ic region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study was to quantify the prevalence and trends of stunting among children using the WHO growth standards. 576 nationally representative surveys. Linear mixed-effects modelling was used to estimate rates and numbers of affected children from 1990-2010. In 2010 it is estimated that 171 million children (167 million in developing countries) were stunted. Stunting has stagnated in Africa since 1990 at about 40% and little improvement is anticipated. Asia showed a dramatic decrease from 49% in 1990 to 28% in 2010, nearly halving the number of stunted children from 190 million to 100 million. It is anticipated that this trend will continue and that in 2020, Asia and Africa will have similar numbers of stunted children. Despite an overall decrease in developing countries, stunting remains a major public health problem in many of them. The data summarizes progress achieved in the last two decades and identifies regions needing effective interventions &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the last few decades, Latin American (LA) governments have implemented innovative budget reforms to improve public spending and the overall impact of public policies. LA’s reforms sought four main objectives: enhance efficiency and effectiveness of spending; incorporate citizen participation in the budget process; increase transparency and control over public spending; and use the budget as a tool to advance rights and equality. This Guide presents an overview to LA’s budget reform experience, emphasising contextual factors enabling the design and implementation of these reforms and on outcomes and lessons learned. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>At present, remittances play a crucial role in the economy of Bangladesh. At the macro level, it helps to relieve our foreign exchange constraint, stabilize the exchange rate movement, and improve the balance of payments. A comfortable foreign exchange reserves can be maintained through increasing growth of remittance which can contribute to overall macroeconomic stability and reduce aid dependency. Besides, remittances are used to pay for imports bills and to repay foreign debt. At micro level, remittance has a beneficial impact on household consumption, reducing poverty reduction and self employment. It also improves countryâ€™s creditworthiness. However, it has been more stable source of foreign earnings than both FDI and foreign aid. The paper examines the determinants of remittance inflow by applying ordinary least square method (OLS). The paper finds that in the short run there exists a positive relationship between domestic exchange rate and remittance and some regu &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A cross-sectional community based study was conducted in four tea gardens of Sylhet division to assess the nutritional status of 1 to 5 years children of tea workers. Nutritional status was determined anthropometrically along with their socioeconomic background and the nutritional status was compared with the data obtained from national survey. Prevalence of wasting was 42.3% whereas that of stunting and underweight was 80.2% and 73% respectively. All these parameters are significantly higher than those obtained from national data (BDHS, 07). Though the children are breast fed at much higher rate in comparison with Bengali children, their motherâ€™s educational status and body mass index are lower than that of Bengali population. The nutritional status of children of tea workers are worse than that of national level. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study addresses the interaction of gender and ICT. It aims at assessing the impact of ICT on gender equality in Egypt focusing on differentials in wage rates and employment opportunities. This aim is addressed by illustrating women's current status in Egypt regarding ICT related education and employment as well as their access to ICT. Further, the study employs two sets of panel regressions with different sector coverage on pooled data during 1996-2006 to test for the significance of gender employment gap in ICT related sectors and to identify factors affecting the gap in ICT and non-ICT related sectors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Focusing on Ethiopia, this paper explores local perspectives on female child marriage and circumcision. Both practices are widespread in Ethiopia and reflect deep-rooted patriarchal and gerontocratic values regulating women&amp;rsquo;s reproduction and transactions between kin groups at marriage. Yet both have been designated as Harmful Traditional Practices (HTPs) by the  Ethiopian government and are proscribed by law, with designated  punishments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper explores the values that drive these practices and examines whether and in what ways they have been affected by efforts to eradicate them. It points to the complexity of beliefs and practices, highlighting differences associated with ethnicity, religion, generation and gender. It finds that the efforts of government and elite leaders to eradicate them are contributing to the diminution or transformation of female circumcision and female child marriage, although with marked regional variations and considerable contestation and resistance in some places. In mapping these processes of change, the paper identifies trends in premarital sex, clandestine surgeries, and other subterfuges that may demonstrate unexpected consequences and adverse reactions to laws which were intended to protect children. In doing so, it emphasises the challenges confronted by child- protection measures designed to bring about change to long-established customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analysis draws on interviews with 25 children and young people from five communities, as well as their peers, caregivers and community representatives, conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2011. The paper uses both statistical and ethnographic evidence to assess the prevalence of the two customs and the cultural and material logic underpinning them. It gives an overview of the external forces militating for change and presents evidence on trends of change. This is followed by analysis of the personal experiences of Young Lives children and the discourses against the practices, as well as a consideration of the resistance to change. Finally, the discussion reflects on wider issues of modernity and rising aspirations for girls. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A cross-sectional anthropometric and retrospective mortality survey was conducted in seven states of Northern Nigeria from 21st July to 28th August 2011. The survey was conducted in Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara states. The main objective of the survey was to determine the nutritional status of children under five years of age and women from 15-49 years. Data were collected from a total of 4,452 households, 6,069 children under five years of age, and 5,727 women of reproductive age.
Results show that prevalence of acute malnutrition was above 10%. The highest prevalence of acute malnutrition was reported in Sokoto and Kano states at 11.8% and 8.1% respectively.. Jigawa state was found with the highest prevalence of underweight children (37.1%) and Yobe had the lowest prevalence (22.3%) Chronic malnutrition ranged between 64.8% and 36.3% in under-five children in Jigawa and Sokoto states respectively. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common convulsive event in children. This condition has been described since the time of Hippocrates. The etiology of the febrile seizures are still unclear. In FS, there is a strong familial predisposition. This does not exclude infections as a causative factor because subtle genetic polymorphisms have been demonstrated to affect the course of infections. In an earlier review of the world literature (1924-1964), except for roseola infantum, viral infections as a cause of febrile seizures were rarely diagnosed. Reports of viral infections in the etiology of febrile seizures have increased in number in the past decade. In the first half of the twentieth century, infections identified with febrile seizures were mainly upper respiratory in type and the etiologic agent was unknown or bacterial. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The future of renewable energy is fundamentally a choice, not a foregone conclusion given technology and economic trends, according to this report. It examines the future of renewable energy in the context of: total energy share by sector; integration between utilities, buildings, industry and transportation; business models and investment; urban planning; national and regional policy; and technology, cost and market growth. The report is based on the opinions of 170 leading experts and the projections of 50 recently published scenarios. It finds a wide range of expert projections of the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2050, with low estimates below 20 per cent to high estimates upwards of 50-95 per cent. Experts predicted that the expansion of renewable will accelerate through 2020, particularly in leading developing countries such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Given that international climate financing requires clear adaptation-related results verification, this guidebook by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&amp;uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) proposes a method for results-based project design and monitoring. Intended for the use of GIZ personnel, representatives of governments, other bilateral donors and non-governmental organisations, this document seeks to answer to the following questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What constitutes an adaptation project and what does not? &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Which specific factors must be accounted for when defining cause-effect correlations and indicators? &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How does this affect results-based monitoring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The guide explains a five-step approach to designing an adaptation project, a results framework for it and setting up a results-based monitoring system. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Step one is about assessing the context for adaptation; outcomes include indentifying adaptation needs and setting adaptation priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Step two is for determining the basic orientation of a project on the basis of the context for adaptation identified in the first step. The following three dimensions with specific relevance for adaptation projects are described: building adaptive capacity, measures for reducing identified risks/vulnerabilities (adaptation actions) and the successful achievement of development despite climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Step three provides guidance for devising the strategic orientation, including setting the project up in conjunction with partners and identifying the underlying assumptions of the results framework. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Step four is about defining indicators and determining a pre-project context (baseline); outcomes include the selection of special methods for results measurement (as needed). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Step five is for operationalising the results-based monitoring system. By this step, monitoring has been operationalised and put into place. In this phase, suitable procedures are put in place to establish a close integration between project steering and the results-based monitoring system. The final outcome is the dissemination of knowledge beyond the project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This practical guide is illustrated with specific examples of indicators and projects, particularly the Climate Change Adaptation in Rural Areas of India (CCA RAI), which illustrate the content and constitute a reference point in designing adaptation projects and their M&amp;amp;E systems. The project&amp;rsquo;s aim is to create political conditions for increasing the adaptive capacity of rural communities on multiple levels and to develop practical instruments for implementation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Various explanations have been advanced for the persistent under‑performance of agriculturein many African countries, where smallholder farming is still the dominant livelihood activityand the main source of employment, food and income. Some of the oldest argumentsremain the most compelling. African farmers face harsh agro‑ecologies and erratic weather,characterised by low soil fertility, recurrent droughts and/or floods, and increasinglyunpredictable weather patterns associated with climate change. Vulnerability to shocks iscompounded by infrastructure deficits (roads and transport networks, telecommunications,potable water and irrigation) that keep poor communities poor and vulnerable, as testifiedby the phenomenon observed during livelihood crises of steep food price gradients fromisolated rural villages to densely settled urban centres. African farmers have also beeninadequately protected against the forces of globalisation and adverse international terms oftrade – for instance, Western farmers and markets are heavily protected in ways that Africanfarmers and markets are not. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>UNESCO believes that mobile technologies can expand and enrich educational opportunities for learners in diverse settings. Today, a growing body of evidence suggests that ubiquitous mobile devices – especially mobile phones and, more recently, tablet computers – are being used by learners and educators around the world to access information, streamline administration and facilitate learning in new and innovative ways. This set of guidelines seeks to help policy-makers better understand what mobile learning is and how its unique benefits can be leveraged to advance progress towards Education for All. Developed in consultation with experts in over twenty countries, the guidelines below have broad application and can accommodate a wide range of institutions, including K–12 schools, universities, community centres, and technical and vocational schools. Policy-makers are encouraged to adopt UNESCO’s policy recommendations, tailoring them as necessary to reflect the unique needs &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Pacific faces many challenges in terms food availability and affordability. This paper investigates the current status of food systems in the Pacific and looks at the changes required for achieving a food secure future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document points that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the two pillars of food production in the Pacific are subsistence agriculture and inshore fisheries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;rural food security is at risk from urbanisation, land tenure issues, and increasing resource scarcity from the Pacific&amp;rsquo;s high population growth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, the impact of climate change is predicted to bring stronger, more frequent cyclones and prolonged droughts &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, imports are increasingly required to fill the dinner plates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper argues that achieving productivity improvements in the face of the above pressures requires strong institutions, adoption of green revolution technologies, and a particular focus on the development of new crop varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the author underscores that sharing best practice traditional techniques among Pacific island countries can improve regional food security. However, the effectiveness of traditional techniques should be improved through research to build future resilience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, the document presents the following policy implications: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;urban gardening programs are a cost effective way to improve food security&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;improving security of tenure will be beneficial, especially for commercial agriculture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;one industry that has potential is mariculture - increased participation by Pacific island countries in tuna fishing will boost urban food security&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;focusing on a range of high value agricultural commodities will help the region realise its comparative advantage &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;increasing processing capacity to develop value-added products would boost export revenues and help overcome trade quarantine issues &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investing in infrastructure and breaking the stranglehold of shipping and other infrastructural monopolies is highly recommendable &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report analyses the extent to which countries have been affected by weather-related loss events. It warns that the window for putting the world on a track to stay below two degrees Celsius is rapidly closing and preparations must be made for potentially more frequent or severe weather events in the future. Published in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP18 held from 26 November to 7 December 2012 in Doha, Qatar, the paper calls on the conference delegates to insert new dynamics, and on the international community to scale-up its response to addressing climate change and associated (and increasing) loss and damage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publication begins with instructions for reading the Global Climate Risk Index. Although it does not provide an all-encompassing analysis of the risks from anthropogenic climate change to countries, it does indicate a level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events. The following are among this report&amp;rsquo;s key messages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Honduras, Myanmar and Nicaragua were the countries most affected by extreme weather events from 1992 to 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Eight of the ten most affected countries (1992-2011) were developing countries in the low-income or lower-middle income country group &amp;ndash; two belong to the upper-middle income countries.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In total, more than 530,000 people died as a direct consequence from almost 15,000 extreme weather events and losses of more than US$2.5 trillion (in PPP) occurred from 1992 to 2011 (US$1.68 trillion overall losses in original values).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In 2011, the ranking of the most affected countries is led by Thailand, Cambodia, Pakistan, El Salvador and the Philippines.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An ambitious work programme on near-term mitigation as well as Kyoto II targets in line with the two degrees Celsius limit are key actions required.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Adequate financial and institutional support should be provided by developed countries to further increase disaster preparedness and resilience of poor countries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper calls for a more committed engagement between ICT practitioners and the development community, and seeks to make two contributions. The first is to show how it has never been more important, as the more mature discipline, for development studies to critique the operation of developmental ICT at policy level, as well as to inform and educate the increasing numbers of, usually foreign, ICT investors and practitioners who are involving themselves in these emerging markets. The second contribution is a description of the fundamental challenge that recent Web 2.0 models of networked social interaction are increasingly likely to pose to more established approaches and debates within development studies itself. Having outlined the challenge, the paper looks at how such thinking, conceived as ’Development 2.0’, may contribute to four of the most pressing current debates within development studies today. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Adolescent girls are an overlooked group within conflict-affected populations and their sexual health needs are often neglected. Girls are disproportionately at risk of HIV and other STIs in times of conflict, however the lack of recognition of their unique sexual health needs has resulted in a dearth of distinctive HIV protection and prevention responses. Departing from the recognition of a paucity of literature on the distinct vulnerabilities of girls in time of conflict, this study sought to deepen the knowledge base on this issue by qualitatively exploring the sexual vulnerabilities of adolescent girls surviving abduction and displacement in Northern Uganda. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An experiment was conducted in farmer's field in the village of Arazi Postompur under sadar thana of Thakurgaon district to study the effect of different irrigation regimes on the yield and yield contributing characters of high yielding potato varieties namely BineIla, Cardinal, Chamak and Heera. The experiment was laid out in split plot design and replicated thrice. Among all the varieties Chamak was found to be superior in respect of tuber yield followed by Heera, BineIla and Cardinal under the different irrigation regimes. Treatment IW/CPE ratio of 1.00 was found the best among the different IW/CPE ratios tried, yielding maximum which was significantly different from other treatments with 5- rounds of irrigations applied at Stalinization, Tuberization, Bulking and Ripening stages of crop growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Green growth involves diverse processes, including conversion to low carbon energy, climate resilience and response to climate shocks. Equity implies a fair sharing of the costs, within and between countries. This working paper explores how equity has been considered in climate change discussions. It discusses per capita emission right approaches and highlights key challenges in the application of equity in global climate change negotiations. A brief overview of key approaches to carbon financing is provided, focusing on recent cost estimations of climate change impacts and projected needs for green growth programmes. It highlights the diversity of estimates and present evidence on the apparent gap between available public financing and green growth needs. The paper concludes by presenting one approach to a global Green Fund to receive assessed contributions of member countries and disburse grant and loan fund to low- and middle-income countries to pursue green growth programmes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Over the past 30 years, total economic losses from natural hazards have more than tripled in real terms. The economic and social impacts have been particularly great in developing countries, where past development gains are at risk and human security is increasingly threatened. This report argues that at a global level, exposure growth could remain the main driver of risk in the short-term, but beyond about 2030, climate change could begin to play a more significant role. Climate change and the rapid accumulation of people and assets in hazard-prone areas increase the need for a more forward-looking approach to disaster risk management. The report concludes that investing in risk reduction now can bring effective, tangible and immediate benefits; reducing risks and building resilience to disasters before they occur is a more cost-effective solution. It also underlines that there is a need to take immediate action to reduce or better manage the underlying drivers of the trends in risk. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Chemical Engineering as a distinct engineering discipline is now more than hundred years old. It was 1888 when Professor Louis Mills Norton first introduced the curricula for Chemical Engineering at MIT. As creative chemists came up with new chemicals it provided ever new challenges to the Chemical Engineers to innovate new industrial processes applying the new found knowledge in unit operations, unit processes, reaction engineering, process control, (later) transport phenomena and (recently) process integration. In Bangladesh the founding fathers of engineering education took a long term view of the industrial development prospects and took the innovative decision to introduce Chemical Engineering curricula in the erstwhile Ahsanullah Engineering College in the early fifties. During these early years large corporations in the public sector provided the initial thrust for development of chemical and process industries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This research is focused on India to examine how ICTs are changing economic opportunities for poor and low-income women. India is a dynamic setting for three important trends: a rapidly expanding ICT sector, an increased role for women in the marketplace, and an emerging economic and policy environment poised for growth and social inclusion. The confluence of these trends is sparking a range of initiatives that use ICTs to engage women in business. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper mainly reviews the experiences of e-governance reforms in improving the quality of governance and service delivery in India. The first section deals with the conceptual framework of egovernance. The second section focuses on e-governance initiatives in India. The third section reviews the implications of e-governance on service delivery in terms of efficiency (speedy delivery, cost reduction and accessibility of service), accountability (transparency and simplification of procedures and actions, reduction of corruption), participation (empowerment with information in formulation, implementation, and monitoring of policies) and equity (benefits for disadvantaged groups and areas/regions) on the basis of secondary resources. The fourth section deals with enabling conditions in promoting e-governance in India. Finally,
the paper elucidates the policy perspectives. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study concludes that the Policymakers and ministry officials face many important decisions, as they cope with sweeping global trends. None is more important to economic and social development than those they make in education policy. By examining the relationships between reforms in curriculum, teaching, assessment, the use of ICT, teacher training, and school organization, and by aligning these changes with important economic and social goals, policymakers can leverage public investments to move from knowledge acquisition to knowledge creation. Early gains in deepening the knowledge of students and teachers can be leveraged to transform schools into learning communities and provide students with 21st century skills. The widespread ability to think critically, communicate effectively, use technology, work well in teams, learn continuously, and produce new intellectual and creative works is the basis for sustained and equitable economic growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study explored violence against women with chronic maternal disabilities in rural Bangladesh. During November 2006–July 2008, in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 rural Bangladeshi women suffering from uterine prolapse, stress incontinence, or fistula. Results of interviews showed that exposure to emotional abuse was almost universal, and most women were sexually abused. The common triggers for violence were the inability of the woman to perform household chores and to satisfy her husband’s sexual demands. Misconceptions relating to the causes of these disabilities and the inability of the affected women to fulfill gender role expectations fostered stigma. Emotional and sexual violence increased their vulnerability, highlighting the lack of life options outside marriage and silencing most of them into accepting the violence. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The illegal trade in wildlife makes up one part of the multi-billion dollar business that is environmental crime and is increasingly being perpetrated at the cost of the poor and vulnerable. To date, conservation efforts have failed the great apes. Year after year, conferences and seminars celebrate a “renewed” engagement to save the great apes, which leaves the participants, as well as the public, with a feel-good sense of optimism. Then, year after year, we are surprised that conservation efforts barely affect the race towards extinction. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Integrated urban environmental plans developed in different Latin American countries show how to reduce systemic challenges in urban areas. Overcoming multi-dimensional urban issues requires a holistic view that includes channels for popular participation, higher level government support and cross-sector collaboration. However, it does not exclude a deep understanding of specific local necessities: in Brazil, transportation was a priority; in Colombia, disaster risk reduction; and in Argentina, decentralisation of public services. A critical overview of achievements in these urban environmental governance processes is key for South Asian and African cities that will need to accommodate most of the world’s urban growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In coming decades, Latin America will have the opportunity of consolidating its progress toward comprehensive development. However, this paper argues this will be confirmed only if countries are able to achieve just and equitable societies that promote opportunities and inclusion, and a more diversified insertion in the world economy with greater value added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author thinks that to confront these challenges, there need to be substantial improvements in a number of factors such as education, innovation capacity, the quality of institutions, and the quality of infrastructure and its associated services. However, the document notices that infrastructure in Latin America lags behind that of other regions of the world and the lags are more acute in some sectors and countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions contain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the strategic agenda for infrastructure in Latin American countries must be based on an understanding of the situation of the infrastructure sectors to extend and improve their services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investment efforts in infrastructure must be aimed at increasing the coverage and quality of water and sanitation services, promoting and supporting urban public transportation and developing infrastructure for regional integration&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the main required elements are financing, improvements in policies, and an adequate consideration of environmental and social aspects &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the use of multiple financing sources and modalities should be optimised, the use of infrastructure should be rationalised, and the capacity for project preparation in the short term should be strengthened &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the exchange between governments, regions, and cities should be promoted &amp;ndash; the region&amp;rsquo;s bilateral and multilateral fora constitute valuable initiatives in this direction&lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>Over two thirds of all human infectious diseases have their origins in animals. The rate at which these zoonotic diseases have appeared in people has increased over the past 40 years, with at least 43 newly identified outbreaks since 2004. In 2012, outbreaks included Ebola in Uganda (see Ebola box), yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Mauritania. Zoonotic diseases have a huge impact – and a disproportionate one on the poorest people in the poorest countries. In low-income countries, 20% of human sickness and death is due to zoonoses. Poor people suffer further when development implications are not factored into disease planning and response strategies. A new, integrated ‘One Health’ approach to zoonoses that moves away from top-down disease-focused intervention is urgently needed. With this, we can put people first by factoring development implications into disease preparation and response strategies – and so move from panic to planning.

    <dcterms:abstract>This article, published in the Glocal Times, discusses examples of citizen media production and communication (blogs and social media sites in Tanzania and its diasporas) in the immediate aftermath of the Gongo la Mboto explosions in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in February 2011. The authors argue that Tanzanian engagement in 'new media' can be seen as an extension and amplification of traditional modes of information sharing and news production, with traditional oral and collaborative processes of news production adapting towards the digital. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Centre for International Development’s guidebook essentially focussed on telecom regulation and ICT trade policy. However, it also highlighted ongoing public policy challenges like legal certainty, security and consumer protection, etc. Besides, it also suggested due consideration for the business environment. In view of such challenges, IT Policy, Legal Framework, especially economic freedom and corruption issues, were also used to arrive at an overall Network Policy Index. From the above, it is evident that there is a wide gap between the policy and implementation in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. However, most countries are placed much better in terms of economic freedom, all crossing halfway mark as per the Economic Freedom Index. In terms of corruption, Bangladesh and Nepal are placed quite low as compared to Sri Lanka and India. In overall terms, India has barely crossed the half-way mark, closely followed by Sri Lanka. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Research on conflict prevention has often left the question of how civilians manage to contain violence in conflict environments unaddressed. This article aims to understand how islands of peace emerge during outbreaks of violence in Cote d'Ivoire.
The authors state that in order to understand the dynamics of restraint in Cote d'Ivoire, they conducted a number of semi-structured interviews in Abidjan and in other three towns. 
Findings are that:
• the national environment, and in particular the institutions of the army and militias, proved to be a decisive factor in the dynamic of peace-keeping and violence restraint in Cote d'Ivoire
• in urban areas, local governance institutions and important personalities have proved to be key figures in the constraint of violence, and the few cases of urban violence are explained by local factors and isolated from the rest of the country
• this reveals the specificity of the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire which is unusual in that it took place in a country with strong state institutions - state local institutions were strong enough to contain violence in urban areas
• Identically, the paper underscores that the politicisation of the Ivorian conflict as a north/south conflict cannot mask the major problem of the Ivorian crisis: the issue of land ownership
Conclusions are that:
• the search for peace and national reconciliation must begin in the west, which is the epicenter of violence 
• the problems of land ownership must be a central concern for the stabilisation of the western region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that hasplagued mankind since Neolithic times (8000 BC). In addition to the review of key papers, we undertook searches of electronic databases. For PubMed, the search items were â€œabdominal tuberculosisâ€ restricted to the past 25 years. â€œGastrointestinal tuberculosis, tubercular ascites, serositis, iliocaecal tuberculosis terms were used for search items.â€,abdominal tuberculosis and pathophysiologyâ€, â€œtuberculosis of alimentary system and diagnosisâ€,â€œantuitubercular chemotherapyâ€ were search items without a time restriction. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Current debate is still largely centred on China?s engagement with African agriculture as either a threat or an opportunity. Such debate will not be resolved without a broader body of empirical evidence on the nature and impacts of the diversity of Chinese agriculture engagements in specific African contexts. This paper explores Chinese narratives on: China?s own agriculture and development success; African agriculture challenges and opportunities; and the nature of China-Africa cooperation, to ask how to best engage with China-African agriculture cooperation to improve the outcomes for African agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper first reviews current literature on China-Africa cooperation for agriculture development and identifies gaps that this paper attempts to fill and methods used in this research. Then a very brief overview is given of the institutional arrangements for China-Africa agriculture cooperation, presenting available data on the nature and scale of these engagements. The following sections present narratives from policy papers, media, statements by officials, literature, and informant interviews on this cooperation towards an exploration of the underlying patterns, justifications, relationships and styles of Chinese agriculture engagements in Africa. In the latter section, challenges to the dominant discourse and potential alternative models are explored. Finally, the conclusion brings forward preliminary assessments of these narratives and suggestions for further research.&lt;/p&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>The end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012) marks a turning point in the history of the clean development mechanism (CDM). This junction warrants posing the question: Did the CDM fulfil its initial design objectives and were there any other benefits? This second benefits report on the CDM aims to answer this question. It updates the previous report (2011) adding several new elements on the overall impact of the CDM. It analyses approximately 4,000 registered CDM projects (excluding programmes of activities) according to four topics: sustainable development, technology transfer, finance and regional distribution. It also includes revised estimates of finance and costs for various types of projects, new estimates of savings and revenue due to the use of certified emission reductions (CERs), examines differences between CDM and non-CDM projects and provides opportunities for improvement in the regional distribution of the CDM. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Brief begins by describing the main challenges to providing sustainable and equitable access to water in the face of climate change impacts. It then highlights four key strategies being implemented in Latin America that are improving sustainable water management policy and practice while also facilitating climate change adaptation. Examples from
across the region and contextual factors that have underpinned improvements in water management and adaptation provide
key lessons to be considered by other countries and regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The core list of ICT indicators presented in this document was the outcome of an intensive consultation process by the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development with national statistics offices (NSOs). This included a stocktaking exercise through which metadata on the status of official information society statistics were obtained from NSOs worldwide, as well as a series of regional events on core ICT indicators. From these processes, a proposal for a core list of ICT indicators was presented by the Partnership, and adopted by participants, at the WSIS Thematic Meeting on Measuring the Information Society (Geneva, February 2005). This document is intended to provide more information on the core list of ICT indicators agreed at the February 2005 meeting. It provides definitions, model questions and methodological notes relevant to the indicators. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has made significant progress in many of its social development indicators particularly in health; however, a vast portion of its people still does not use health care services from medically trained providers. An attempt has been made in this study to investigate levels and patterns of health care exclusion among women in Bangladesh. A face to face crosssectional survey was carried out in a total of 674 married women, selected with the convenience sampling technique. This study was carried out in Bancharampur sub-district under Bramman Baria district and Mirpur sub-district under Dhaka district from 1st July to 30th July in 2010. Results revealed that the mean health care exclusion score was 14.0 (SD=4.40) out of 21. The least used reason to explain health care exclusion was â€œA doctor recommended a surgery for a family member but we did not have it doneâ€, with only 9.9% of the subjects giving this reason. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change vulnerability and food insecurity often have common root causes. Accordingly, measures that address these causes can reduce both problems at once. This is especially important for the many African countries that face daunting agricultural challenges. This ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network shows how Zambia’s Conservation Farming Unit (CFU) and the World Agroforestry Centre have been pioneering ‘evergreen agriculture’ solutions since the mid-1990s to address these problems. Evergreen agriculture combines agroforestry with the principles of conservation farming, by integrating particular tree species into annual food crop systems. Zambia is using evergreen agriculture in two practices: maize agroforestry and conservation agriculture with trees. Both of these systems tackle the need to replenish soils in affordable ways using natural fertilisers; in short, re-employing old indigenous knowledge practices. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Africa Environment Outlook (AEO) is a tool of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) for monitoring environmental management in Africa. This third edition focuses on the links between environment and health, and includes subsections on: air quality; biodiversity; chemicals and waste; climate change and variability; coastal and marine resources; freshwater and sanitation; and land. It finds that environmental risks contribute 28 per cent of Africa's disease burden, and highlights that environmental and health issues deserve priority consideration in national development. On climate change, the report recommends: integrating climate-related scientific findings into decision-making; building adaptive capacity; and strengthening early warning systems, preparedness and response. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In India over 60 per cent of the labour force is dependent on agriculture, a sector which is highly sensitive to climate variability. This study aims to examine the impact of climate variables, such as temperature and rainfall, on crop production through temporal analysis focusing on the Tamil Nadu state in India. The study results reveal that among selected crops production of groundnut and bajra were negatively affected by maximum and minimum temperatures. The study suggests that suitable strategies for increasing the adaptive capacity of crops may include change in planting dates to bridge the yield gaps, and evolving adverse climate tolerant genotypes. Farmers could be assisted by providing weather linked value added advisory services and weather-based crop insurance. The mitigation of climate change can include utilisation of opportunities offered by conservation agriculture, use of biofuels, development of watersheds in rainfed areas and nutrient management. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>When the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (the TRIPS Agreement) was concluded at the close of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1993, it represented a remarkable expansion of the international framework for intellectual property rights. It imposed enhanced standards for what Member states had to protect, including a requirement to protect pharmaceuticals by patents. It also established, for the first time, minimum standards for the enforcement of substantive intellectual property rights and subjected all of these obligations to binding dispute settlement. 
A key issue for Bangladesh in this context is to what extent existing as well as possible new TRIPS rules create an opportunity for the development of policies to encourage the growth of its domestic pharmaceutical industry. To date, the international community has not delivered an organized and useful response to the health crisis in developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Since the early years, e-government in Malaysia has come to be seen as a key component of governmental strategy for achieving the national developmental goals. While such goals capture some essential elements of MDGs and Malaysia has already recorded significant gains in a number of MGD areas, challenges in other fields have made the task extremely critical for Malaysia to achieve a fully developed country status by 2020. In view of this, the Malaysian government has redoubled it efforts by initiating and implementing e-government programs and projects, alongside other policies and projects. As a result, the type and number of e-government projects have grown steadily with variety of services made available electronically. All this has helped improve Malaysia’s profile in global e-government ranking. This paper provides an overview of some of these e-government schemes indicating the nature of innovations introduced and their significance in governance and service delivery. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Matching defined contribution schemes are gaining popularity in both rich and poor countries as a promising means to reduce gaps in the participation in formal pension systems. Matching contributions by employers, the government, or both to defined contribution schemes are used alone or jointly with other interventions to motivate participation in pension schemes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originating in several high-income settings there are now a number of innovations and substantial experience in low-income countries in using this design to stimulate coverage and savings. This experience now provides a rich opportunity for learning, not just from the longer experience of a few high-income countries but also the more meaningful South-South learning across developing countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This report reviews the experience with matching pension contributions across the range of countries that have used the design.&amp;nbsp; The description and analysis of this experience which is the product of partnership and collaboration across many public and private institutions provides an early assessment of the design to inform policy makers and practitioners as well as serve as a model for the kind of cooperation that will be required to address this difficult challenge. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

The idea to create this China–Lusophone countries Forum was developed between the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and the Executive Government of Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) not long after Macau’s handover to China on 20 December 1999. Trade between China and the Lusophone countries has risen rapidly, along with soaring Chinese investment and development aid, with a special focus on the African Portuguese-speaking countries. This report asks why China is interested in the Lusophone countries, assesses China’s strengthening bond with them, asks what the Lusophone countries themselves gain from the relationship, and analyses how the Macau forum specifically works. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The role of information and communication technology acceptance and usage in universities has been the focus of IS researches. Universities in Nigeria require adequate ICT facilities to augment face to face teaching. Acceptance has its models, and the most current is UTAUT. This study investigates the acceptance and usage of ICT by the University of Port Harcourt (Unipart) academic staff, using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model and other TAM constructs. One hundred questionnaires were administered and collected. The data collected was runned by SPSS version 17. The UTAUT model theory was verified using regression analysis to understand the behavioral intention of the university academic staff towards acceptance and use of ICT in their workplace. The objectives are to examine the factors associated with ICT acceptance and usage and to measure the most influential factors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The analysis of the Japanese GSP Scheme shows that preferential access to the Japanese market in case of such products as textile/apparels could be of high potential benefit to Bangladesh; more particularly, the zero-tariff market access provided for knit-apparels under the revised Japanese GSP Scheme should be accorded due attention by Bangladesh’s policy makers. However, as was pointed out in the final section, a list will need to be done to penetrate the fashion conscious Japanese apparels market. 
As was evinced from our analysis, targeted actions need to be designed in order to ensure maximum benefits from the two newly introduced Japan’s GSP Schemes. Whether the scheme can be translated into a meaningful market access initiative, will, in all likelihood, hinge on the successful implementation of such measures. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>E-governance has been perceived as a key to better governance. Though e-governance is capable enough of reaching to its objective, the problem of last mile connection is still persistent in developing countries due to unavailability of required infrastructure to provide e-governance with required depth. It has been witnessed that developing countries have deeper telephonic/mobile penetration than the internet penetration. Hence the use of telephone/mobile as a tool to supplement e-governance in its last leg becomes imperative. The higher level penetration of mobile connection makes the problem of last mile connectivity some how redundant. Mobile-governance (m-governance) may be used as supplement to e-governance in a spoke and hub model. It will be helpful in bridging the digital divide particularly in rural areas and also in developing parts of world mainly Asia and Africa. This paper discusses e-governance and m-governance in a spoke and hub model. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>UTI is an important cause of acute illness, it may be a marker of underlying urinary tract abnormality. Bacteria causes the large majority of UTI in children-Escherichia coli is the most common (90%) bacterial cause . Urine culture &amp; sensitivity is the gold standard for the diagnosis and mandatory for confirmation of UTI. On culture, a colony count of more than 105/ml organisms of a single species is considered confirmatory of UTI. But there is a strong recommendation that , presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 Colony Forming Unit (CFU) / ml of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen makes the diagnosis. There is a recommended imaging schedule in childhood UTI to detect anatomical abnormality. Management depends on type of infection. There is no role of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent febrile recurrent UTI without VUR. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Rapid adoption of mobile telephony in rural India and absence of other information and communication technology media have prompted the social sector to exploit mobile communication as a dependable and effective ICT media. Intervention studies and projects in low resource settings of developing countries have underlined multiple roles and effectiveness of mobile communications in the health sector. In particular, the delivery function of public health programs can be improved by using prompts and reminders through SMS and voice calls for the health workers. In the state of Orissa in India, for example, mobile videos were instrumental in improving the quality of counseling among the community health workers. These messages have been successfully utilized in assisting the beneficiaries achieve their health behavior goals. Improvement in quality and timeliness of data can help the health system dynamically manage the delivery and promotion functions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. This is the first Sub-Report on the District of Lago. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article presents the benefits and importance of using multimedia in the math classes by the selected examples of multimedia lessons from geometry (isometric transformations and regular polyhedra). The research included two groups of 50 first year students of the Faculty of the Architecture and the Faculty of Civil Construction Management. Each group was divided into two groups of 25 students, one of which had the traditional lectures, while the other one had the interactive multimedia lessons. The main source of information in multimedia lectures were the softwares created in Macromedia Flash, with the same definitions, theorems, examples and tasks as well as in traditional lectures but with emphasized visualization possibilities, animations, illustrations, etc. Both groups were tested after the lectures. In the both multimedia groups students showed better theoretical, practical and visual knowledge. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report presents the results of a stakeholder analysis, which had the following objectives: to identify potential partners in the research process, to find out which organizations could make use of the research findings in their activities, and to derive implications for the communication and outreach strategy of the research project. In addition to a review of documents and individual interviews, a stakeholder analysis workshop was conducted in Bangladesh on November 15, 2011. A participatory mapping tool referred to as Net-Map was used to conduct the stakeholder analysis. The results of the stakeholder analysis are expected to be useful not only for the “Enhancing Assets” project, but also for other organizations and projects that work in this policy field. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study discusses the future of public health in digital cities. The digital city thematic action line proposes to create new, robust, and in many cases, invisible information systems that are part of the urban infrastructure. This invisibility is imagined to be a result of the seamless integration of new information systems with the existing methods of travel, recreation, and consumption within the city. Currently, technologies such as electronic travel cards, credit cards, and personal identification cards are used by city dwellers in their daily activities. Attempts to integrate these systems to combine the benefits, and increase convenience at the same time, occur often. Examples include credit cards with photos of their owners that can be used for identification, and travel cards with built-in credit. Proposals for new syndromic surveillance systems can also be situated within the same trend, aiming to take advantage of increased data collection for public health purposes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) have released a new publication series intending to document and circulate good practices, share progress, stimulate discussion, and inform priority interventions and advocacy efforts to address the rising HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Asia. The MSM Country Snapshots were initiated in recognition of the difficulty of accessing up-to-date country-level information on MSM and HIV. Most importantly, they allow for convenient access to key findings for anyone with limited access to academic journals or knowledge of sources for biological and behavioral surveillance data. The documents synthesize key findings at time of publication that span four areas of strategic information: epidemiological, behavioral, programmatic and legal. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Most governments around the world still designate their budgets without specifically linking them to human rights improvements. This brief describes how the first budgeting process with a human rights approach was designed and implemented by the Government of Mexico City (GMC) (Gobierno de la Ciudad de M&amp;eacute;xico), analysing the process, initial outcomes and lessons learned, to help potentially replicate the initiative in other contexts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic is considered low-level, with 1,544 cumulative reported cases and an estimated 3,000 people living with HIV. Infections related to sex between men account for approximately one-eighth of total reported cases. Other key affected populations include injecting drug users and female sex workers. HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) is low relative to other countries in the region but is increasing, both in HIV prevalence and as a proportion of total infections. There is little evidence to suggest that Sri Lanka&amp;rsquo;s epidemic will become generalised in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first detected case in 1987, Sri Lanka has demonstrated a progressive commitment to a comprehensive response. Socio-economic and cultural factors are taken into account when designing programmes. To date, the National STD and AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) has been unsuccessful in scaling prevention programmes targeted to MSM and is yet to develop community sensitive clinical services. The NSACP&amp;rsquo;s attention to MSM is characterized by a non-continuous series of awareness programmes primarily in Colombo, Kandy, and Anuradhapura and occasional support to groups working for the human and political rights of LGBT communities in Sri Lanka. Despite strong civil society interest in operating targeted HIV prevention interventions, limited and inconsistent funding has limited the expansion of such activities. In addition, the limited capacity of MSM community groups in administration and financial management contributes to funding issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka&amp;rsquo;s laws are unsupportive of MSM and present significant challenges to effective HIV prevention programmes. A sodomy law that punishes sex between men with long-term imprisonment is used to extract bribes and threaten individuals and LGBT organizations. Negative societal attitudes towards homosexuality discourage access to critical health services targeted at MSM. In response to growing concerns of homophobic violence, the NSACP issued a &amp;lsquo;special policy statement&amp;rsquo; to voice support for the protection of the rights of MSM and sex workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Sri Lanka reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An experiment was conducted at the Agronomy Field Laboratory, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh to find out the effect of pre and post emergence herbicides on weed control and the performance of different varieties of transplant aman rice. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Pre-emergence herbicides showed the best performance in reducing weed density and comparatively better grain yield. As a result, net income was also increased. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has immense prospect for exporting vegetables to the world market and it has also produced high quality exportable fresh vegetable. Although the share of export earning in vegetables increasing day by day but export is constrained by several issues. Thus the present study was undertaken to determine the value addition, cost and return of vegetables production and export at different levels and also suggest some policy implication for improving the present system. The study was based on both primary and secondary data. The sample included vegetables producer, suppliers, and exporters. Vegetable producers and suppliers were selected from Ulokhola of Kaligonj Upazila and exporters were selected from Dhaka city (Motijheel, Kakrail, Shantinagar, Khilgaon, and Sham Bazar).Among all the cost items, airfreight charge was the highest. It was revealed from the study that bitter gourd cultivation is more profitable and BCR is also highest (3.27) and UK market was more profitable. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Despite the increasing importance of mobile devices in education, the essential features of these devices for ubiquitous learning have not been empirically addressed. This study empirically investigated the necessary conditions for using mobile devices as an educational tool for ubiquitous learning in higher education by a conjoint method. The results show that respondents want to use Window-based large-screen devices for their educational purposes; thus, current tablet PCs might not be suitable in terms of screen size and type of platform. The findings also implied that potential users want to receive ubiquitous access by using advanced cellular networks, but they do not need comprehensive functions related to office documentation on their mobile devices. Therefore, this study suggests that both policy makers and business players consider developing the optimal educational mobile device as soon as possible for the successful dissemination of ubiquitous learning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

In the present study, development phases of winter rice (boro rice) of BR3 and BR14 varieties for the years 2008, 2030, 2050 and 2070 have been simulated for 12 major rice growing Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of Bangladesh using DSSAT model. Available data on soil and hydrologic characteristics of these locations, and typical crop management practices for boro rice were used. The weather data required for the model were generated for the selected years and for the selected locations using the regional climate model PRECIS. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This work is a survey of the conditions for the use of ICT in five countries in Latin America: Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico. In several municipalities, mayors, leaders and authorities were interviewed and many local organizations visited. Both the factors determining good governance at the local level and their relatedness to ICT were examined in order to increase knowledge on this relationship. Aspects considered were: decentralization, citizen participation, transparency and grassroots movements, alternative experiences, popular participation and social- movements networks. In interviews and group meetings information was collected on whether these aspects were present or not in the communities or in government guidelines, and whether, in some way, there was a link between these social expressions and the use of ICT. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document is recommended to be used to structure India, to understand its innovation ecosystem in general and specifically in ICT in the central government and national levels, briefly also in state level. It should be used also to outline business and innovation potential in this huge and quickly growing and developing nation or rather a subcontinent. Of course, India is not an easy market to understand or to enter. But the market benefits from a healthy degree of competition and growth exceeding global growth, although in most ICT business areas it is high - volume, low - cost and low - profit market. In order to survive in the new global economy, companies have to engage with China and India, not only with USA and EU. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The ICT Professional Development Strategy for Teachers in Guyana could provide a quick and cost-effective way to enhance and overhaul existing teacher programmes in environments with few resources, including human resources. ICT are currently integral to many educational changes throughout the world. They have dramatically changed the learning and teaching environment, and have opened up new opportunities and access to educational resources well beyond those traditionally available. The ICT Professional Development Strategy for Teachers in Guyana was developed in 2011. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Over the past ten years, an increasing number of countries are initiating, negotiating and agreeing new trade agreements between two countries or amongst a group of countries. These are commonly known as free trade agreements or “FTAs”. They are promoted as providing significant economic benefits to signatory countries through the removal or reduction of barriers to trade in goods and services. Many political leaders have indicated that they would prefer to remove or reduce trade barriers through the multilateral system in a way that benefits all countries belonging to the World Trade Organization. Nevertheless, given that the “Doha Round” of negotiations is taking longer than initially anticipated to be concluded, bilateral and regional FTAs are often seen as a way to move forward the trade liberalization agenda in the meantime. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report examines the feasibility of private investment in wind power in Colombia within the current regulatory framework. It focuses especially on the regulatory methodology for estimating the ‘firm energy’ that wind power plants are capable of providing in Colombia to back up hydro generation during extended periods of drought (El Niño weather events). The report concludes that the current methodology probably underestimates wind’s firm energy contribution by a substantial amount. This in turn means that wind power stations receive a lower firm energy payment than they should. The authors argue that this could be an important barrier to investment in wind power in Colombia and recommend that the Colombian government reconsiders its methodology for estimating the firm energy capacity of wind power and of other (non hydro) sources of renewable power. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article, written by Ana Elena Obando following the World Social Forum (WSF) in Porto Alegro, Brazil, analyses perceived sexist contradictions at the WSF and challenges resistance movements to self-reflect and become more inclusive. It argues that the violence against women in the Youth Camp of the WSF, which saw 90 reported cases of harassment, assault, indecency and rape, yet only one arrest, is a stark reminder of the WSF's failure to include a gendered perspective, and how this is not only detrimental to social movement building, but also has real, harmful effects on women personally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three contradictions are noted by the author: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Despite sharing general opposition to neoliberal capitalism, militarisation and environmental destruction, Obando notes that in her experience resistance movements also share a lack of opposition to fundamentalisms, particularly religious, that impact women. This is not to say that social movements cannot work alongside religion; liberation theology, for instance, has supported movements in their fight against fundamentalisms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; This contributes to compartmentalised and undemocratic resistance that feminists must once again strengthen from the inside, a resistance within the resistance, ensuring a gendered perspective in the building of an alternate world. An example of the issues faced lies in the Manifesto of Porto Alegro, a document produced by 18 men and 1 woman that establishes 12 points the WSF proposes globally without mention of a gendered perspective. The author notes that as an open space, the WSF is not a representative body for global civil society and cannot assume the right to speak for the entire group, and is an antidemocratic and sexist practice of power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; There is a significant gap in WSF activities between the rhetoric of gender mainstreaming and practice. Women continue to navigate between women and with women, struggling to incorporate gender into other movements. Mainstreaming must go beyond merely adding the word 'woman' to policies, without budgetary support of real understanding of the concept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article finishes with a description of events at the Youth Camp of the WSF in Brazil. 35,000 students, artisans, feminists, etc. gathered in a &amp;ldquo;facade&amp;rdquo; of an open and progressive space; within this space young men kidnapped and raped women. This presents a fourth contradiction: the gap between espoused political values and individual action of the 21st century &amp;ldquo;Che Guevara look-alikes&amp;rdquo;. Obando writes that the camp succeeded in practising the values of the WSF (whose moniker states &amp;ldquo;Another World is Possible&amp;rdquo;), in that it failed to include women in a safe and progressive space. A group of feminists marched through the camp in protest, and the Lilac Brigade were formed: women who wore lilac bands on their arms to indicate their willingness to help other women who had suffered abuse. Women were angry, frustrated and saddened by events, asking if 'another camp is possible?' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author concludes that the WSF must review both their methodology and their vision, and address the issues of sexism, patriarchy and undemocratic organisation that threaten to do real harm in weakening collective civil society as a whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As one of the most carbon (C) rich ecosystems in the world, the conservation and restoration of tropical wetlands represent a priority for climate change mitigation. Deforestation, agri/aqua culture conversion, pollution and coastal development have all contributed to the loss of over one-third of mangroves in the last fifty years; a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. This is the context laid out in this study, which seeks to quantify the ecosystem carbon stocks of the Sian Ka&amp;rsquo;an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Such quantification is important in order to establish a baseline that can then be monitored over time and it is a necessary prerequisite for mitigation strategies such as REDD+. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The methodology of the study is explained in detail, including a description of the geography, flora and climate of the study site. In total, nine different coastal wetland sites were sampled, representing four kinds of vegetation: tall mangroves (2 sites); medium mangroves (2 sites); dwarf mangroves (3 sites); and marsh (2 sites). Using methodologies outlined by Kauffman and Donato (2012), the authors collected data necessary to calculate the total C stocks from standing tree biomass, downed wood and soil (which was also sampled for Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) concentration and interstitial salinity). Scaling up the calculations and the statistical analysis used are then discussed. The results showed that tall mangroves had the highest C stocks, followed by the medium and the dwarf mangroves. At all of the sites, soil C comprised the vast majority of the C stocks (between 78-99 per cent), with correlations suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In total, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka&amp;rsquo;an may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The nature of medical education in Bangladesh is inherited from the then Pakistan. Although the task force set up in the year 2002 for updating new curriculum, promulgated in the academic year 2003-2004, it essentially remains the same for undergraduate medical education. About 20 in public sector and at the time of writing this paper about 38 medical colleges in private sectors conduct a five years course and offer MBBS degrees to more than 5000 students enrolled per year. The ratio of public to private sector graduates is almost 50:50. So far, medical education in Bangladesh is the shared responsibility of three different authorities ministry of health, Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BM&amp;DC;) and on the regional basis of existence any of the public Universities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Child labour is a multi-dimensional and complex issue. It is a symptom of economic vulnerability of people, inadequate legal system and labour laws, cultural and social inequities, as well as a result of an inaccessible and low-quality educational system. Child labour and education are inextricably linked. Child labour impacts on the enrollment rates, dropout and transition rates at the primary and secondary education level. Concomitantly, an inaccessible and low-quality educational system increases the incidence of child labour and thereby causes an even poorer quality of life for the most vulnerable in society. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>International climate policy is increasingly characterised by the growing involvement of developing countries. In addition to a stronger willingness to participate in global mitigation efforts, there are many examples of domestic mitigation programmes. For example, in 2009 Brazil made a substantial voluntary commitment to reduce its emissions. This paper discusses the dynamics behind the change in Brazil’s position, focusing on the effects of international influences. In conjunction with important domestic changes, a set of interacting influences through a variety of pathways both changed preferences among important interest groups in the Brazilian society towards favouring some kind of commitments and helped to change the structure of government fora and decision-making rules in a way that empowered reform-minded ministries. It is argued that this perspective is increasingly relevant for understanding the influence of external actors on climate change politics in developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper was prepared by Frances Cairncross, Management Editor of The Economist, and Kaija Pöysti, Partner in Blue White Venture, a consulting company. “ICTs for education and building human capital” forms part of the Visions of the Information Society project managed by Lara Srivastava, Policy Analyst in the Strategy and Policy Unit of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). This study discusses that getting the best from ICTs depends on several variables, including the appropriate design of software and hardware; the training and attitude of instructors; and the realization that different students have different requirements. It also requires a willingness to experiment: effective use of ICTs in education and training is likely to require quite different pedagogical techniques from traditional classroom teaching. These will probably take a long time to devise and disseminate. Moreover, the new emphasis on cost-effectiveness may discourage innovation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>After brief comments on the launching of the Department of World Religions in the University of Dhaka, this paper reviews concisely the contributions of significant sociologists to comparative academic study of religion, in some cases having had foundational impact on how the field or discipline variously called ‘history of religion’ or ‘comparative religion’ or ‘science of religion’ came to define itself in contrast to theology or ‘confessional’ study of religion. The influence of these and other sociologists has also been significant for developing the subfield of sociology of religion. In general sociologists have been rigorous in seeking objectivity in
research, although objectivity may include observing the feelings and intentions of human beings which influence their overt actions. The relations of religion to politics as well as to social norms and morality have attracted much attention from sociologists. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this paper authors present a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) scheme for a specific ICT4E program that supports teaching and learning using mobile computer supported collaborative learning (MCSCL). Using the information provided by the scheme, we analyze the program’s impact on student attainment in terms of teacher adoption of innovation. It was found that there were statistically significant positive differences in students whose teachers showed higher adoption levels when compared both to lower adoption cases and other defined control groups. We conclude that an M&amp;E scheme supports the intervention process by providing real-time information for decision making through the application of assessment instruments according to a monitoring plan. This enables intervention activities to be adjusted so as to ensure an adequate level of adoption. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>"E-banking" refers to systems that enable bank customers to access accounts and general information on bank products and services through a personal computer (PC) or other intelligent device.Its products and services can include wholesale products for corporate customers as well as retail and fiduciary products for consumers. The main focus of this study is to examine the performance,problems and prospects of E-banking in Bangladesh. The study is descriptive in nature. It reveals that E-banking depends mostly on IT.At present, it is a subject of widespread interest in Bangladesh. The government has declared IT as a thrust sector.The study recommends that a comprehensive E-banking will be possible only when there will be political commitment with better IT infrastructure,internal network,country domain and,above all,a high speed fiber optic link to the information superhighway. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper has investigated the patterns of inequality that have emerged in rural Bangladesh in the decade of the 2000s. Two findings stand out clearly– distribution of income has become more unequal over the decade, and, somewhat surprisingly, distribution of consumption has remained more or less unchanged despite widening income inequality. The main analytical task of the paper was to search for the underlying causes responsible for these two apparently contradictory trends. The root of widening income inequality was found to lie in the unequalising effects of foreign remittance, and to a lesser extent, that of income from self-employment in non-agricultural activities. These two sources of income were also the driving force behind rapid growth of the rural economy. This poses a trade-off between growth and equity, which
the policymakers need to resolve – for example, by making foreign migration more affordable to people of small means. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper offers a critical review of current debates on the importance and the potential of ICT for modern cities. Much attention is given to the opportunities offered by local e-governance, as a systematic strategy to exploit the potential of ICT for the public domain in European cities. Since the views of many experts and elected policy-makers in cities (so-called ‘urban frontliners’) is coloured by subjective expectations and perceptions, we examine in particular the extent to which
the expected influences of ICT, as perceived by urban frontliners, affect their perceptions of the relevance of ICT to mitigate contemporary urban challenges. The final (empirical) part of the paper addresses the issue of the systematic study of cyber perceptions of cities in Europe. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Sierra Leone is one of a number of states that underwent a period of civil war and collapse after the end of the Cold War. This article offers a bottom-up review of the post-war reconstruction of the Sierra Leone state. 
The paper points that the impact of the civil war on human security and governance in the rural areas was devastating, yet rural communities remained intact. In this respect, the pre-war traditional leadership structures continued informally to provide a degree of governance response. As a result, the author believes that the social contracts between society and the state, communities and their chiefs, and chiefs with the center, have been re-established in Sierra Leone, and especially in the rural areas. 
In addition, the paper concludes the following:
• it is clear that governance does not disappear when the state collapses, especially the structures of local and rural governance
• yet, the consequence is that a post-conflict state has much more need for decentralisation - as well as possibilities for achieving it
Accordingly, the document argues that Sierra Leone government and its development partners will need to address the following issues:
• the ability of the chieftaincy to undergo changes that would make it more compatible with the democratic ethos that has grown from the war
• the tension between the chiefs and the district councils, which seems a potential source of weakened legitimacy
• the unclarity of the institutional boundaries of the newly reconstructed multilayered governance system
• the insecurity of the reform of police sector, and the needs to reinforce it. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report contains the main findings of a strategic review on communication infrastructures and paperless administration in Spain, selected themes covered by the Plan Avanza 2 (thereinafter, “the Plan”). The OECD reviewed in 2010 the previous information society strategy, Plan Avanza, and published the report Good Governance for Digital Policies: How to get the Most Out of ICT. The Case of Spain’s Plan Avanza. Spain launched Plan Avanza in 2005 and, to sustain its efforts to advance its information society, approved, in July 2010, Plan Avanza 2. Addressing the major challenges currently faced by Spain, this information society strategy has aimed to foster economic growth and to place the country in a leadership position in the advanced use of ICT services and products to improve public service delivery and overall national competitiveness. This review provides ground to further improve these policies and their outcomes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Both Research and Development (R&amp;D) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) investment have been identified as sources of relative innovation underperformance in Europe vis-à-vis the United States. In this paper we investigate R&amp;D and ICT investment at the firm level in an effort to assess their relative importance and to what extent they are complements or substitutes. We use data on a large unbalanced panel data sample of Italian manufacturing firms constructed from four consecutive waves of a survey of manufacturing firms, together with a version of the CDM model that has been modified to include ICT investment and R&amp;D as the two main inputs into innovation and productivity. We find that R&amp;D and ICT are both strongly associated with innovation and productivity, with R&amp;D being more important for innovation, and ICT investment being more important for productivity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Pacific is among the last regions of the world to form itself into a functioning bloc to promote trade, investment, migration and security. This paper looks at the main areas where regional architecture in the Pacific is either established or now being built, as well as some ideas that help community to best take advantage of the Pacific potentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper shows that the first regional political grouping was the South Pacific Forum (the Pacific Islands Forum now), but political cooperation has been less evident. On the other hand, the author invokes the finding of a study that regionalism can contribute to improved Pacific livelihoods, but only if the process goes beyond trade and investment to include regional public goods. Consequently, the document wonders whether starting with a foundation based on trade is the best framework for fostering a Pacific community, suggesting the need to establish the social-political-cultural bedrock first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific regional architecture will be one of the main avenues through which the existing and new geopolitical great powers will seek to exercise their influence&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;therefore, Pacific leaders need to identify the best way to play the geopolitical game to ensure peace and prosperity &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this respect, greater Pacific ownership and representation in the regional bodies is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;furthermore, the myth that strong sub-regional groupings are a threat to regionalism should be dispelled, and it is time to face the reality of three distinct sub-regions within a region&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;additionally, an inclusive debate on whether Pacific nations want to move towards a united Pacific (with a single currency, open borders and the free movement of production factors) should be run &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study aims to investigate the teachers’ perceptions of the barriers and challenges preventing teachers to integrate ICT in the classroom. Therefore, a validated questionnaire was administered to 30 high school English teachers who were selected from the five main educational districts in the city of Isfahan, Iran. Stratified random sampling was used to select equal number of respondents from each educational district. The findings indicated that although teachers had a strong desire to use ICT in the classroom, they were encountered with some barriers. Insufficient technical supports at schools and little access to Internet and ICT were considered as the major barriers preventing teachers to integrate ICT into the curriculum. Moreover, the descriptive analysis of the results showed that shortage of class time was another significant barrier discouraging teachers to use ICT into the classroom. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper by the World Health Organization addresses the social dimensions of climate change from a sustainable, equitable development perspective, understood as ‘an irreducible holistic concept where economic, social and environmental issues are interdependent dimensions that must be approached within a unified framework’, and where the overarching outcome is to fully promote human welfare and equal access to life-sustaining resources. The aim of the paper is to broaden and deepen policy-makers’ understanding of the benefits of addressing and incorporating the social dimensions of climate change into climate policies. In doing so, the paper identifies a number of knowledge gaps within the social, human and natural sciences that need to be filled in order to further strengthen policy responses. The underlying argument is that people are at the centre of a successful transition to a world of far-reaching and balanced global reductions in emissions and enhanced resilience. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Since its independence in 1971 when it was recognised as belonging to the group of LDCs, Bangladesh has been enjoying preferential treatment under the various GSP schemes. Although subject to Rules of Origin of varying degrees of stringency, these GSP schemes offered two major benefits: (a) preferential market access in the form of reduced (or zero) tariff for particular products, and (b) greater market access in the form of enhanced quota or quota/ceiling free entry of particular products into domestic markets of developed countries. As is known, these preferential market access schemes are necessarily subject to various rules of origin (RoO) which are specific to individual GSP schemes, and often also vary between products within a single GSP Scheme. Bangladesh has been a beneficiary of the GSP scheme run by the EU since her independence. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In South Africa, both under- and over-nutrition exist. Chronic malnutrition is a bigger problem than acute malnutrition. Stunted children have a higher risk for being overweight. At national level, 33.3% of preschool children are vitamin A deficient, 21.4% are anaemic and 5.0% suffer from iron deficiency anaemia. Prevalence figures for childhood malnutrition differ between and within provinces. South African children consume a maize-based diet that is inadequate in energy and of low nutrient density. Inadequate intake of micronutrients starts during infancy. Strategies to address micronutrient malnutrition include high-dose vitamin A supplementation, food fortification, biofortification and dietary diversification. A broad multifaceted comprehensive health intervention programme is needed to address childhood malnutrition in the country. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Where the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh&amp;nbsp;was once a prosperous agricultural hub, today it is an &lt;br /&gt;area ravaged by salinity, natural disasters, poverty&amp;nbsp;and an inability to cope with recurrent shocks. This paper presents the main findings of a survey made in collaboration with the local NGO Uttaran in&amp;nbsp; the southwest coastal belt of Bangladesh. The objective of the study was to capture the main&amp;nbsp;challenges, impacts and effects of climate change on&amp;nbsp;livelihoods in this region as well as identify levels of&amp;nbsp;disaster resilience and existing coping strategies being utilised. What was found was a much more complex&amp;nbsp;array of interlinking factors which together, present&amp;nbsp;significant barriers to livelihood opportunities and&amp;nbsp;sustainable development for communities, and the&amp;nbsp;region as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper argues that establishing and enhancing livelihoods resilience, maintaining food security and fostering development are now the main priorities for the region.&amp;nbsp; One recommendation is to  target  small  landowners  and  farmers  in  communities  with  an  existing mix of shrimp and paddy farms to encourage  a return to balanced agricultural activities such as rice farming and/or saline resistant varieties of vegetable and/or sweet water prawns/fishes. The introduction  of crop diversification and short lifecycle crops would  enhance  resilience  and  the  ability  of  farmers  to  recover quickly after disasters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activities would  require strong local  government&amp;nbsp; support and  be  closely  linked  with  relevant&amp;nbsp; government departments  Training&amp;nbsp; and  education  on  the  use  of  flood  irrigation&amp;nbsp; techniques to reduce salinity levels to allow rice and&amp;nbsp; vegetable  cultivation would  be  a  priority focus.&amp;nbsp;  Market acceptance analysis of different crop and rice&amp;nbsp; varieties should be undertaken as well as support for horizontal knowledge-sharing  between  farmers  on saline-resistant crop varieties and appropriate variety&amp;nbsp; selection. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Conflicts over control of and access to natural resources are common among pastoral communities living in arid and semi-arid environments of Kenya. This study investigates conflicts and conflict resolution strategies in West Pokot County, Kenya. The objectives were to: identify the sources of conflict; examine conflict resolution initiatives; and evaluate the effectiveness of peacebuilding initiatives. The study found that peacebuilding initiatives were able to decrease incidences of historical conflict between pastoral communities and the Pokots (living in West Pokot County), but they did not decrease conflicts associated with natural resources, especially those related to scarcity of pasture and water. The study highlights that climate change mitigation was absent in all peacebuilding initiatives in the county and recommends that mitigation efforts should be the focal point in addressing conflicts in pastoral regions since climate change is causing the decline of natural resources. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This is the final report of the study launched by the European Commission, Information Society and Media Directorate G, Components and Systems on Best practices for Even Gender Distribution in the 25 MS in the domain of Information Society Technologies. The objective of this study on best practices of even gender distribution in Europe 25 is to foster the participation of women in the ICT domain and to provide relevant input for further European policy developments and their implementation in the area. This has been done by identifying, selecting and analysing different best practices cases in major public and private European ICT organisations. Existing statistics demonstrate the low participation of women in the ICT sector, and particularly in decision making roles. The study gives a overview of strategies and measures in the area of gender equality in ICT with the expectation that they will be transferred and applied to other organisations with the same positive commitment &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The French military intervention in Mali was deemed necessary when radical Islamists threatened to expand their hold to the whole country, potentially creating a safe haven for al-Qaeda in the Sahel. However, the success of this intervention depends on a sound understanding of the complex dynamics of internal conflict and fragility in Mali. The immediate priority is to push for political reconciliation and provide urgent humanitarian aid. The EU can play a crucial role in promoting extensive consultation with all stakeholders, economic empowerment and stabilisation of Mali's tense civil-military relations. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>There is a paucity of rigorous evidence on the impact of microcredit for the ultra-poor. Studies on microcredit do not tend to explore what, how and why different types of solutions work best for different types of clients. The available evidence gives a mixed picture on the impact of microcredit in general and for the ultra-poor in particular. The ultra-poor are commonly not reached by mainstream microcredit services. When they are reached, some studies find that microcredit can have positive impacts; others that it has disproportionately less of an impact and sometimes a regressive effect on the poorest. Experts warn that, given microcredit makes some people poorer and not richer, it is imperative to be particularly cautious when targeting the ultra-poor. Conventional microcredit models can be adapted to meet the needs of the ultra-poor, across the following areas: identifying and removing barriers to participation; monitoring; flexible loan conditions; supervision, training and support; linking economic strengthening with other services; and providing a ladder of financial services. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) face trade-offs between pursuing profit and reaching the poorest; some programmes serving the poorest may not be financially sustainable without additional support. A number of ‘graduation programmes’ aim to bridge traditional re-distribution schemes and conventional microfinance programmes. They help participants to graduate to using mainstream microfinance services, via the transfer of income-generating assets, food aid, health services and skills training. There is a growing evidence base on the impact of these types of programmes. This brief report is organised in four sections: 1. it summarises evidence on the impact of microcredit for the ultra-poor 2. it presents findings on supply-side design of microcredit for the ultra-poor 3. it focuses on apex funds for the ultra-poor 4. it summarises evidence on the approach to graduating the ultra-poor into microcredit. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The food system is facing unprecedented pressure from environmental change exacerbated by the expansion of global agri-food corporations. With a large proportion of sub-Saharan African countries’ gross domestic product still heavily reliant on agriculture, global trends in agri-food business are having an increasing impact on African countries. This paper uses interview data with corporate executives from South African food businesses to explore how they are adapting to the dual pressures of environmental change and globalisation. It shows that companies now have to adapt to macro-trends both within and outside the formal food sector and how this in turn has repercussions for building sustainable farming systems − both small and large-scale. The paper concludes that businesses have strategically recognised the need to align the economic bottom line with social and environmental factors, but real sustainability will only happen when all stakeholders are included in food governance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Electronic commerce, very important part of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICT), is one of the most common business terms in use in 21st century. Developed countries are more popular because of their rapid growth of ICT, e-commerce and online transaction. But in developing or under develop countries the scenario is different. Technical laggings, dearth of infrastructure, infeasibility of the existing frameworks and people apathy are the main reasons behind this. There are several alternative ways of e-commerce and online transaction. Mobile payment, a way of online transaction, may be beneficial way of payment for developing countries because of its mobile network infrastructure. In this paper, a model of electronic payment system for M-Commerce has been proposed and analyzed the 
security for the system. The paper also touches on the conditions and criteria that must be met in order to make an M-Commerce transaction acceptable under Islamic perspective. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change presents health risks that must be addressed by both decision-makers and public health researchers. Within the application of Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA), there have been few attempts to incorporate climate change related health risks as an input to the framework. This study used a focus group design to examine the perceptions of government, industry and academic specialists about the suitability of assessing the health consequences of climate change within an EHIA framework. Practitioners expressed concern over a number of factors relating to the current EHIA methodology and the inclusion of climate change-related health risks. These concerns related to the broad scope of issues that would need to be considered, problems with identifying appropriate health indicators, the lack of relevant qualitative information that is currently incorporated in assessment and persistent issues surrounding stakeholder participation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper addresses issues of Information and Communication Technologies in the context of the education sector in Swaziland. The Ministry of Education and Training recognizes the critical use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the transformation of society to ultimately meet the universal requirements of an ever changing global environment. The education sector also recognizes that the new information and communication technologies are closely linked with many aspects of human activity and therefore clearly significant in lifelong learning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mental retardation is one of the most prevalent developmental disabilities of the children globally. Family is the main source of support for those disable children in any society. Parents experience enormous physical and mental stress to tackle the mentally retarded children. This present comparative cross-sectional study tried to compare difference of mental and physical stress between the parents of children with mental retardation and the parents of children with no mental retardation. It included 220 parents, 110 of whom had children with mental retardation and another 110 parents of children with no mental retardation. To assess stress, A Quick Stress Assessment Test (QSAT) (Vaz, 1995) was used, which comprised two parts: physical and mental, former with 19 items and latter with 21 items. Data were collected with a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed by using SPSS software. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This book emphasizes the critical need for strategic national level policies, long-term in its vision and comprehensive in nature, targetting both the immediate needs of the populace and long-term needs of nations being integrated in the information age. Only via coherent and complimentary policies that engage both the private sector and civil society organizations, can nations move forward towards creating a digital society that addresses the macro economic viabilities of nations within the digital economy and also leveraging capabilities of ICT to address the social,economic, and political issues on the ground. It is with this regard that the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals provide an excellent starting point. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Trends have been changed in poisoning in our country. Transport related poisoning is an emerging social and public health emergency in Bangladesh. As no remarkable studies has been done in this issue before, so there is no clear cut data about mode of poisoning. In this study it showed that the mode of poisoning is usually food with mixed benzodiazepines preparations. This prospective study was done in the Medicine unit of Sir Salimullah Medical College &amp; Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, from July to December 2004. All the poisoning cases admitted in Medicine Unit of Sir Salimullah Medical College &amp; Mitford Hospital, Dhaka are included in this study. A total 100 cases were studied. Among all the poisoning cases, ‘street poisoning’ by sedative hypnotic drugs were the highest percentage (37% of the total) and all were male. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Building on a vulnerability and adaptation assessment of Lami Town, Fiji, this report presents a cost-benefit analysis of four adaptation scenarios, two of which are focused on ecosystem-based options and the other two on engineering options. The report lists the adaptation options available to Lami town, namely: planting mangroves; replanting stream buffer; monitoring and enforcement; reducing of upland logging; reducing coral extraction; rebuilding sea walls; reinforcing rivers; and increasing drainage. It finds that the highest benefit-cost ratio is for ecosystem-based options, with FJ$19.50 benefit for every dollar spent. The report concludes with recommendations and a step-by-step process for decision-makers to guide adaptation planning and implementation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mobile technology stands out as more robust and sustainable option as compared to PC based telemedicine in remote rural villages in India, with the increasing penetration and rising transmission capabilities of mobile networks. However, the technology becomes a powerful transformational tool if it is applied as an enabler of a synergistic system. This paper describes a healthcare delivery model based on mobile technology as an information transmission tool between rural patients and centrally located providers, using trained intermediaries as local facilitators, entrepreneurs and health activists. A customised handheld device that carries added features like biometric identification of all users, thermal printer, smartcard reader and writer and USB ports for connecting external diagnostic devices, was configured to collect healthcare information. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>India has 78.29 million hectare under forest and tree cover (Forest Survey of India, 2011) which is 23.81 per cent of the total geographical area of the country. However, the country’s forests are facing immense pressure due to unsustainable use of forest produce. This paper underlines that poverty and forest degradation are inextricably linked and curbing forest degradation requires convergence of various poverty alleviation policies and schemes. The role of local communities is vital in not only addressing the drivers of forest degradation but also enhancing carbon stock through conservation, protection and reforestation, i.e. the implementation of REDD+ in India. The paper concludes that while in the REDD+ readiness phase, a fund-based mechanism is recommended for supporting REDD+ activities, possibilities of a market-based mechanism could be later explored. The Green India Mission may present an opportunity to have a fund-based mechanism for financing REDD+ projects. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>What are the roles, capacities, contributions and limitations of civil society in changing local and global contexts? This report is an output from the The Civil Society at Crossroads initiative in which regional focal institutions worked with a wide variety of local partners to identify and document the stories of civil society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two kinds of narratives have emerged from discussions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The first kind told the story of civil society in a country over a period of two to three decades; these included India, Cambodia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Netherlands, Russia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; the second kind of narrative focused upon a particular issue around which a citizen movement or civil society actions were mobilised. These included the anti-corruption movement in India, the farmers' movement against land grab in Cambodia, the commuters struggle in Indonesia, the citizens' protest in Malawi and Uganda, the Occupy movement in UK, the citizens' movement in Greece, the student movement in Chile, the women's movement in Uruguay, the campaign for LGT rights in Argentina, 'roof over our heads' in Latin America and Makassar community actions in the Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Within these contexts the project has aimed to look at the following issues:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;how do endogenous, informal, spontaneous, sporadic and emerging forms of civil society operate locally?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;what types of interactions do these informal formations have with more formally constituted actors (like NGOs)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;what are the dynamics of interactions between civil society and political society at the national and sub-national levels?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;how does private business interact with and influence the local civil society? Where are the points of convergence, divergence and contestations?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;what is the nature of indigenous, local and sub-national civil society in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries? What resource and capacity challenges do they face today?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;what are the new challenges faced by civil society in emerging, middle-income societies?&amp;nbsp; What is the impact of declining international assistance in these contexts?&amp;nbsp; What patterns for resourcing civil society are evolving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and frosts, is reducing agrobiodiversity in Latin American mountain regions due to the inability of plants, animals and entire ecosystems to adapt to unprecedented climatic variability. In turn, this is having negative impacts on agricultural production and food security. This Brief begins by describing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and food production in Latin America’s mountainous areas. It then provides examples of how Latin Americans are capitalising on traditional and scientific knowledge to develop locally-appropriate initiatives, and finally, it identifies ongoing challenges for Latin America and describes key contextual factors that have facilitated development of climate change adaptation startegies to preserve and promote agrobiodiversity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>There is a wealth of literature available on theory-based evaluation and impact evaluation (TBE), but experts disagree on whether TBE is a common and clearly defined approach. Some think a common conceptual and operational understanding has been elusive, while others point to a completely consistent basic concept regardless of slight differences in the use of terminology. Some core features appear consistent across the main accounts of the TBE approach: 

Opening up the black box to answer not simply the question of what works, but also why and how it worked. This is key to producing policy relevant evaluation. 

Understanding the transformational relations between treatment and outcomes, as well as contextual factors and aiming to identify the ‘mechanisms’ that make things happen. This goes from asking whether a programme works to understanding what it is about the programme that makes it work. 

Having two key parts: conceptual (developing the causal model or theory of change that underlies a programme, and using this model to guide the evaluation); and empirical (testing this theory of change to investigate how a programme causes intended or observed outcomes). 

Being issues led, and therefore, methods neutral. Some of the variations in TBE strategies are: •Approach to types of theory: whether the black box is empty, full of theories or inhabited by people, and the implications for how to accumulate knowledge and establish the theory of change. 

Approach to causal inference: the realist evaluation approach adopts a generative approach to attribution seen by some as distinct from other (i.e. experimental) designs; other approaches promote the use of a range of techniques and tools to make counterfactual comparisons under the TBE approach. This review highlights the following key points from the literature. 

Some promote the benefits of applying a TBE approach to experimental designs. 

Much of the guidance proposes the use of mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) while leaving open exactly how to go about choosing the appropriate design of mixed methods. 

Few studies apply the approach in practice. 

Guidance has been developed on the TBE approach and tools for evaluating complex and complicated programmes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document is a compilation of available worldwide ICT4E policies and plans, at both a national and Ministry of Education level. To enhance the reach and quality of teaching and learning through the effective use of ICTs, policy makers need to be aware of how to best utilize ICTs to create value-add for their country’s education system. A supportive policy environment and framework, developed at the national level is key to the successful integration of ICTs into any education system. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

Beginning with an overview of efforts to improve governance in the region, it then analyzes recent progress in the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in the Asia-Pacific region to promote more efficient, cost-effective, and participatory government, facilitate more convenient government services, allow greater public access to information, and make government more accountable to citizens. Successful adoption of e-government presents major challenges. The paper concludes by examining the practices regional organizations follow to cope with the challenges, while maximizing the benefits. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The species of the tropical Andes - an area incredibly rich in biodiversity - are suffering from multiple pressures related to human population growth and its consequences, particularly the negative effects of climate change. This book highlights that changes in average temperature will be accompanied by large fluctuations and long-lasting changes in the distribution and amount of precipitation, as well as the elevation of clouds in the region. It presents a synthesis of the biogeographical patterns and a comprehensive assessment of how climate change is expected to affect the biodiversity of the area. The publication hopes to aid conservation and adaptation planning in the tropical Andes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>this publication by UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) and the Association for Progressive Communications Women’s Networking Support Program (APC WNSP), placing the discussion of ICTs and gender within a gender equality framework. While acknowledging the benefits, both real and potential, of the much-heralded Information Society, they have moved forward to address the implications of integrating a gender perspective at a national level. What policies need to be put in place? What steps can be taken to expand the reach of good practice examples? It is time we move the discussion from the potential to the reality, and begin an in-depth policy dialogue on how to operationalize the recommendations that have been signed and agreed to by Member States. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The specialized training course has been prepared within the framework of the project Information and Communication
Technologies in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) launched by the UNESCO Institute for
Information Technologies in Education in 2002.
The course offers opportunities to acquire and develop the knowledge and practical skills necessary to establish, manage
and appraise ICT-mediated teaching and learning in TVET. Each unit of the three-module course includes
instructional objectives, relevant training materials for each objective and corresponding application exercises. Personal
assessment of training needs at the beginning of the course helps learners to plan an individual programme of study.
Training programme effectiveness is measured by means of evaluation questionnaires at the end of the course.
Designed especially for policy-makers, managers and administrators of TVET institutions, programme planners,
training and programme development specialists. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this article, we have tried to develop a clear concept of approach i.e.-language theory and learning theory and also presented the idea of method i.e. - a way of teaching a language which is based on systematic principles and procedures. Subsequently, we have tried to clarify the notion of context. In the discussion, I have attempted to explain why the consideration of contextual factors is vitally important in applying an approach or method by a language
teacher while she/he teaches. I have also examined and given references to the context of my teaching experience in Bangladesh which are relevant to the thesis of this article. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>With growing internationalisation, traditional linkages between India and Africa are gradually emerging as a “dynamic and vibrant trade and investment partnership”, argue the authors of this paper, benefiting many partner economies. The paper outlines the rapid economic transformation of India’s economy and its emergence as major market, which has provided major opportunities to partner countries, and examines the increase in India-Africa trade, as well as Indian investments on the African continent. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>From Freshwater Action Network (FAN) and WaterAid, this report includes case studies and examples of water and sanitation programming. By leveraging the expertise of local civil society organisations (CSOs) and networks (28 partners from 14 countries) the programme aims to increase the capacity, resources and voice of civil society 'policy communities', including marginalised groups, to participate in effective and inclusive evidence-based dialogues with decision-makers in the water and sanitation arena. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>According to this paper, forest transitions across the world result from the relative strengths of causes favouring forest losses and gains, which are very context specific. The paper highlights that these transitions are led by a combination of one or more of the following factors: acute crisis of availability of forest goods and services; incentives for abandonment of marginal croplands; enhanced agricultural productivity; massive urbanisation; globalisation; demand displacement; agroforestry intensification; appropriate forest policies; aesthetics; enhanced public awareness; and legal imperatives. Popular discourse on REDD places high emphasis on poverty eradication, good governance, low corruption, restoration of land and human rights of indigenous people. The authors argue that these are important goals, but there is not much evidence that their successful pursuit would result in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Niger’s wetlands are critical to poverty reduction, food security and biodiversity conservation, especially given the irregularity of rainfall and the amount of land suitable for agriculture. The people of La Mare de Tabalak, a wetland in the arid zone of Niger, are already dealing with the cumulative effects of recurring droughts, a trend expected to increase with climate change. This report argues that the co-management of the area among all actors within the watershed should be prioritised and further analysis of the country's climate projections are needed to improve decision-making. It recommends that a regular, continuous system is introduced to monitor and survey environmental and socioeconomic conditions within the watershed. Moreover, ensuring that men and women have the same opportunities and rights, while recognising their different interests, needs and responsibilities, can help alleviate poverty and improve resilience of households and communities to climate hazards. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Limited progress has been made in the past decade in reducing the high levels of maternal and child deaths in the Lao People&amp;rsquo;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). This paper highlights the fact that Laotian women and children are inadequately covered by basic healthcare services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the use of medical services is very low in the country, compared with other countries in the region&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;admission costs are higher on average at public hospitals than at private clinics, indicating that the cost barriers to care in public services are quite high&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thus, the high costs of obtaining medical treatment discourage poor families from taking their sick children for medical care &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, rich families and those living in urban areas are almost twice as likely as poor families and those living in the countryside to seek medical treatment &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the author clarifies that the share of out-of-pocket medical spending in total household spending is still not high because of the low use of healthcare services in the Lao PDR compared with other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;to improve access to maternal and child health services and the outcomes of such services, the Lao PDR should focus on expanding the service delivery network in rural areas to give more families ready access to healthcare facilities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, it should focus on reducing the costs of obtaining treatment at public facilities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Expectations are high when it comes to ICT opportunities for women in developing countries, including new forms of learning, education, health services, livelihood options and governance mechanisms. However, on a cautious note, it needs to be realised that information and communication technologies by itself cannot be an answer and elixir to all problems facing women development but it does bring new information resources and can open new communication channels for the marginalised communities. It offers new approaches for bridging the information gaps through interaction and dialogue, building new alliances, inter-personal networks, and cross-sectoral links between organizations. The benefits include increased efficiency in allocation of resources for development work, less duplication of activities, reduced communication costs and global access to information and human resources. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study aims to provide a concise overview of the literacy issue and explain how ICT can be used to enhance literacy education and contribute to achieving the Literacy Decade goals. The booklet will focus on five areas where ICT can be utilized in literacy education: enhancing learning; raising access to literacy education; training of teachers; localizing content; and creating a literacy-conducive environment. Examples of the use of ICT in literacy education will be provided, including examples drawn from the reports produced as a result of the “Study on Best Practices in ICTbased Education”, conducted by UNESCO Islamabad in 2004. The study examined the use of ICT in education in seven of the E-9 countries, Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Mexico, Pakistan and the People’s Republic of China, and was carried out as part of the UNESCO “ICT for the Promotion of Literacy” project. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The present investigation was aimed at exploring the effect of psychosocial factors of social identity in Chakma tribal people living in three hilly districts of Bangladesh. Gender and education were considered as independent variables to investigate the multifaceted aspect of social identity in this tribal people. total 200 participants (100 males and 100 females) were selected from Chakma tribal population residing in the hilly Districts of Chittagong, Rangamati and Khagrachhari. Two criteria viz. graduates (school and college teachers) and non-graduates (college students) were considered and purposive procedure was used. Initially 25 students were stratified on the basis of gender
and level of education for each cell. Then 25 students were selected randomly in each cell. Each division was again equally categorized into respondents of graduate and non-graduate of 50 participants in each category. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Growth in Vanuatu has accelerated in recent years. This paper argues that Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s growth acceleration is important for the Pacific - it dispels the myth that the Pacific island economies cannot grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper clarifies that Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s experiment confirms the range of factors which are important for growth in the Pacific. In this regard, the document points that macroeconomic stability has been important, but is far from the only factor underpinning growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key messages include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s recent growth has been led by the private sector, not by aid&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s upsurge in tourism and construction would not have been possible without an active land market&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanuatu has also benefited from deregulation (i.e. the opening up of the telecom and air travel sectors)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, social stability underlies Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s recent success&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s recently-gained access to foreign labour markets boosts its growth prospects &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the document states that Vanuatu&amp;rsquo;s future is not assured, considering that all small island economies are volatile and easily destabilised. On this point, the author notes that Vanuatu has a long way to go, and faces a wide range of reform challenges, such as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;improving health and education indicators&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;promoting further structural reform&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reducing corruption&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;maintaining social stability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ensuring law and order&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;promoting equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yet, the author emphasises that Vanuatu has gone much further than achieving macroeconomic stability, and that it has good prospects for long-term growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The focus of the paper is on the benefits that ICT integration in education can provide, right from breaking time and distance barriers to facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing among geographically distributed students. The findings reveal that it also facilitates sharing of best practices and knowledge across the world. ICT increases the flexibility of delivery of education so that learners can access knowledge anytime and from anywhere. It can influence the way students are taught and how they learn as now the processes are learner driven and not by teachers. This in turn would better prepare the learners for lifelong learning as well as to contribute to the industry. It can improve the quality of learning and thus contribute to the economy. It provides several tangible and intangible benefits for all stakeholders involved in the economic growth of the country. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid spread of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), new opportunities have been opened for a revival of public discourse and improved governance efficiency. ICTs offer concrete opportunities for local and national governments to improve their performance in terms of transparency, participation and decentralization. The mainstreaming of ICTs within planning and design of development strategies helps to strengthen the establishment of efficient, effective and transparent governance systems. This paper takes a critical look at Democracy and Governance. What constitute Good Governance was also itemized. The role of ICT in entrenching Democracy and Good Governance was also discussed. Finally, conclusion was drawn and recommendations for way forward were given. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Right to Education is the primary right of every citizen of India, whether a child resides in a high profile society or in a far away not so developed secluded village, according to the Article 45 of Indian Constitution the basic elementary education must be provided to all the children up to the age of fourteen years. Even after 64 years of independence some States in India are still struggling to achieve Universal enrollment, retention and quality education. There are about 1303996 or more than one million rural schools among 6,38,000 villages in India. Schools in rural areas are promoted to raise the level of education and literacy in rural India. The main aim of running these types of schools in India is to increase the rate of literacy in
rural areas. More than 40 percent of India’s population is illiterate and cannot read or write. Schools in rural areas are
inadequate and often equivalent to being non-existent. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this Report on e-Governance, the Commission has examined various aspects of e-Governance reforms in India. The Commission is of the view that even in any e-Governance initiative, the focus has to be on governance reforms with the technological tools provided by ICT being utilized to bring about fundamental changes in the governmental processes. In view of the wide range of e-Governance initiatives that have been carried out in India with varying degrees of success as well as the diversity of conditions in the country, the Commission recognizes that e-Governance projects have to be designed for specific contexts and environments. The Commission has analyzed the progress made as well as the lack of progress in several e-Governance initiatives including some components of the NeGP. It has tried to glean out from such experiences, certain general principles, cross-cutting issues and key constraints that are likely to be relevant for e-Governance projects in the country. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This practical guide was written for Oxfam staff to inform and inspire their work, and to share with partners and peers, but it is also useful for anyone else interested in this subject. The guide begins with an outline of key concepts and discusses some of the causes of violence against women. It outlines the importance of an intersectional perspective to think about who are the women and girls who face most discrimination, and which sources of discrimination and privilege increase the risk of violence. Next the guide introduces Oxfam&amp;rsquo;s rights based, transformative approach to tackling violence against women, with several examples of what this approach means in practice. Some areas of work explored are working with survivors of violence, transforming attitudes and social norms, and working with men and boys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next section of the guide focuses on tracking change. Several examples of theories of change for violence against women programmes and campaigns are illustrated, and there is guidance on how to build a theory of change. There is also useful information on monitoring, evaluation and learning, with examples of tools from Oxfam programmes. Finally the guide outlines a couple of examples where violence against women awareness and prevention has been integrated into broader humanitarian work, as well as some words of caution on the possibilities for efforts on women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment to actually increase vulnerability to violence. Throughout the document there are short exercises for readers, which help to think through the issue on a practical level. At the end of the guide there is a glossary of key terms, suggestions for monitoring questions and indicators, and a list of further resources. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Internalized stigma among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) is prevalent in Bangladesh. A better understanding of the effects of stigma on PLHA is required to reduce this and to minimize its harmful effects. This study employed a quantitative approach by conducting a survey with an aim to know the prevalence of internalized stigma and to identify the factors associated with internalized stigma among a sample of 238 PLHA (male=152 and female=86) in Bangladesh. The findings suggest that there is a significant difference between groups with the low- and the high-internalized HIV/AIDS stigma in terms of both age and gender. The prevalence of internalized stigma varied according to the poverty status of PLHA. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) found 10 of 15 items loaded highly on the three factors labelled self-acceptance, self-exclusion, and social withdrawal. About 68% of the PLHA felt ashamed, and 54% felt guilty because of their HIV status. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Besides other reasons, to meet the commitments towards Millennium Development Goals BRAC introduced the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction/Targeting Ultra Poor programme. To facilitate the programme, thus bring positive changes in
the life of ultra poor, a Gram Daridro Bimochon Committee, comprising the elite of the community, was formed. The committee appeared to have a short active life. The study ethnographically observed the life cycle of a committee from its inception to the
dormant stage. In this observation, the study in addition to depicting the dynamics and performance of the committee tried to single out the reasons for it becoming dormant and what could be done to keep the committees active even after when the programme discontinued its regular contact with the committee. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>India, recognising the challenge of pursuing economic growth in a sustainable manner, has developed an energy efficiency scheme to govern large energy consumers. According to this ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, there is great potential to improve efficiency in energy-intensive industries and the electricity sector, which together were responsible for about 60 per cent of India’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2007. The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme aims to tap into this potential. Energy efficiency measures under PAT will help reduce emissions by 26 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Co2e) by 2015, thus contributing to the national target of 20-25 per cent reduction in carbon intensity from 2005 levels by 2020. This brief provides an overview of the scheme, examines key issues related to its design and implementation, and concludes with some early lessons for countries considering similar initiatives. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The first part of this paper looks into the ways we perceive the world and how it
influences the way we mould it; it also looks into the entangled beliefs we cling to.
The second part takes a 360 degree overview of the horizon to scan the drivers of a
possible storm. It provides viable examples of transitions in different continents and
of unviable practices with high environmental and social costs for humankind. The
third part presents what is at the heart of this paper: the different logic that can allow
a transition towards value at a local level and wealth at a global level. The fourth part
is about the transition itself, the proposed steps, those who can make it happen, the
policies that facilitate it, and a mechanism that can accompany this transition. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Although climate change affects men and women differently, there are few studies on specific adaptation practices disaggregated by gender. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing adaptation practices to the effects of climate change in the Bahi and Kondoa districts of the Dodoma region, Tanzania. It examines perceptions of climate change and identifies elements influencing adaptation practices. A sample of 360 respondents, 12 focus groups and 78 key informants were consulted; the analysis involved descriptive statistics for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data. The results reveal that women are more committed to adaptation practices that enable them to adapt to or reduce food, water and firewood shortages, while men are more dedicated to practices that enable them to adapt to or reduce effects of climate change on crops, livestock and the environment. The findings hope to assist in formulating appropriate adaptation practices for the agriculture sector. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This annual report for 2011-2012 of the World Agroforestry Centre advocates the introduction of 'evergreen agriculture'. On one hand, agroforestry can improve livelihoods, restore degraded soils and raise crop productivity. On the other hand, conservation agriculture, which involves disturbing the soil as little as possible, keeping the soil covered with organic matter and rotating crops, has also helped African farmers to increase their crop yields and incomes. Combining these two approaches leads to what can be called 'evergreen agriculture' - a practice which could transform the fortunes of millions across sub-Saharan Africa. The report also looks at issues relating to water, soil and climate change, including evidence to support the adoption climate smart agriculture. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>How can each nation secure government that is honest and not corrupt, that serves the public interest and not special interests, and that aims to deliver practical solutions to today’s most pressing problems? How can corporations and institutional investors achieve good governance of their own, that protects and promotes long term value while complying with legal norms, ethical standards and customer expectations? What is the relationship between good corporate and democratic governance? Indeed, is either possible without the other? This conference report sought to uncover answers to such pertinent issues, and also explored key questions detailed in the event's following sessions: Crafting effective law, regulation and enforcement within and across borders; Strengthening the business and investment case for managing corruption risk; Linking a wider group of civil society organizations, including faith groups, behind the push for integrity in the public and private sectors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study considers Khulna, Jessore, Satkhira and Bagerhat districts as the south-west region of Bangladesh.The intra-region raw material sourcing is the dominating trend prevailing among the manufacturing firms of the south-west region of Bangladesh.The wider horizon of raw material source is positively related to the operating profit to sales ratio and negatively related to the sales growth rate. This trend indicates the necessity to expand raw material sources of the manufacturing firms for attaining higher profit––the ultimate objective of a business entity. A massive improvement in infrastructure will encourage more firms to widen their horizon of input market. This point needs to be addressed properly for improving performance of the firms located in this region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture was brought under the purview of GATT, 1994 with a view to minimise distortions in global trade in agricultural and food products. Negotiations on agricultural sector trade had earlier been excluded from GATT on the ground of food security and socio-political stability, which makes agriculture different from other sectors of the economy. 
many countries in the Asian region are reconsidering their policies on trade in agriculture and positioning themselves within the umbrella of AoA to protect the agricultural sector. Within this context it is important and timely for Bangladesh to assess its comparative position vis-à-vis other countries in the region, particularly with regard to India with whom Bangladesh has already had a huge imbalance in trade. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper investigates the profitability of 78 Islamic banks in 25 countries for the period of 1992-2009. The Fixed Effect Model (FEM) used to analyse profitability shows that profit efficiency is positive and statistically significant with operating expenses against asset, equity, high income countries and non-performing loans against total loans. Interestingly, the empirical results show that more profitable banks are those that have higher operating expenses against asset, more equity against asset and concentrated at high income countries demonstrating close relationship between monetary factors in determining Islamic banks profitability. The findings for 1998 Asian Financial Crisis and 2008 Global Financial Crisis are negative and imply that Islamic banks’ profitability has not been impacted during Asian and Global Financial crises. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Epidemiological data provide strong evidence for a relationship between undernutrition and life-threatening infection in infants and children. However, the mechanisms that underlie this relationship are poorly understood. Through foetal life, infancy and childhood, the immune system undergoes a process of functional maturation. The adequacy of this process is dependent on environmental factors, and there is accumulating evidence of the impact of pre- and post-natal nutrition in this regard. This review outlines the impact of nutrition during foetal and infant development on the capacity to mount immune responses to infection. It provides an overview of the epidemiologic evidence for such a role and discusses the possible mechanisms involved. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information communication technologies (ICTs) have been promoted as tools for national development and for gender empowerment in many developing countries. In the Caribbean, governments, non-governmental organizations and training institutes play a key role in ensuring access to ICTs among women. Gender empowerment is equated to access to information and technology but there are several concerns related ICT access and their effective use among women that are not adequately addressed. This study addresses these issues as well as social, cultural, economic and other factors that challenge women’s access and use of communication technology. The study recommends further research in policy development to focus on identifies challenges and strategies that will ensure women’s participation in their own empowerment through ICTs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The 2007 elections spawned Kenya&amp;rsquo;s worst election-related violence and resulted in sharp criticism of the police. In light of lessons from 2007, and also from previous elections, this Policy Brief presents arguments for the adoption of guidelines for policing the March 2013 elections. It offers recommendations for measures that aim to enhance a democratic approach to policing the elections, in consideration of the present challenge of low levels of public confidence in the police and the demands of the Constitution and other laws for police accountability and civilian oversight.&amp;nbsp; The brief argues that the era of secretive, hostile and unaccountable policing is in the past and that the onus is now on the National Police Service to bring the institution in step with the demands of contemporary democratic policing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key guidelines for the 2013 elections include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;individual officer preparedness - every police officer on election duty is expected to know relevant electoral laws and particularly electoral offences found in the Elections Act 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;political impartiality - this is a reiteration of the constitutional requirement that officers shall be non-partisan and apolitical in carrying out their responsibilities related to elections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;transparency in public order management - police are committed to providing necessary information to facilitate holding of public gatherings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;also adequate communication and managment for public gatherings &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;media communication to the public &amp;ndash; managing the information flow to the public to ensure the approach of the police is clear at all times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;cancellation of public gatherings where necessary&amp;nbsp; will be done with due regard for the constitutionally protected political rights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;minimal use of force&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;an approach of disclosure and accountability on any deaths arising at public gatherings&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;election incidents reporting &amp;ndash; the police commit to noting, recording and reporting electoral incidents that arise during policing or the elections&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;accountability and oversight institutions &amp;ndash; the police, as per law, are accountable to the Internal Affairs Unit, the National Police Service Commission and the Independent Police Oversight Authority. The police will keep records on electoral incidents, which shall be availed impartially as required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Strategic Planning (SP) offers an interesting, participatory strategy for addressing the challenges in better managing the Latin American urban environment. SP is different from conventional urban planning because of its cooperative process, drawing in businesses, civil society and different government agencies. It promotes these groups’ continuing 
cooperation in envisioning the city’s future, diagnosing problems, planning, prioritising, mobilising resources, and implementing and monitoring initiatives. This brief describes the SP process followed in Latin America, and concludes with lessons learned that will be useful for other cities seeking an effective way to engage in urban planning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Resulting from the first Open Knowledge Festival in 2012, The Open Book is a crowdsourced, multi-author publication built to contextualise the international movement for open knowledge in the words of those who are helping build it today. What are the aims of this movement&amp;rsquo;s pioneers, and how does its prioritisation of digital transparency, open data, government accountability and the Commons impact society? This book will highlight the hopes of those who are working to provoke global change in these areas and introduce their passions to new audiences. Based on contributions from an international group of thought leaders working in fields as diverse as sustainability, design, business and development, The Open Book will serve as a platform for discussion and a launching pad for new ideas about the future of a global movement in a time of rapid technological and societal progress. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>China’s long march to the WTO has been closely followed by other member countries with great interest, and in some cases, great concern. On the one hand, many countries are optimistic that China’s entry into a rule-based system will be beneficial to the global trading system and there will be important positive externalities as a result. On the other hand, China’s accession to the WTO is a source of concern for many countries, which perceive China as a threat to their presence in the global market.
 Bangladesh, in many ways epitomises this guarded approach to the issue. As is well known, Bangladesh’s major strength in the external sector is the textiles and clothing sector, particularly the ready-made garments (RMG) sector. In the context of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) negotiated during the Uruguay Round, Bangladesh’s RMG sector is going to face formidable challenges in the global market specifically in view of the phasing out of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) under &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is arthritis of unknown etiology that begins before the 16th birthday and persists for at least 6 weeks; other known conditions are excluded1. JIA is a complex genetic trait. Despite the genetic contributions to disease risk observed in many case-controls studies, familial JIA is rare2. The level of risk to family members of a JIA proband appears to be relatively low as compared with other autoimmune diseases3-5. Because no one gene or mutation is sufficient to result in disease, but must interact with one or more other genetic factors, the probability of disease occurring in more than one family member is relatively low. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This brief describes the work of the New Visions education programme in Egypt, which is designed to build the life skills of boys and young men, increasing gender sensitivity and reproductive health knowledge. The programme ran between 2002 and 2004, following on from the New Horizons education programme for girls. New Horizons staff had realised that the goal of supporting young women could only be achieved if family members and the broader community were supportive of gender equality. The programme for boys and young men took place in youth centres, and was conducted by volunteer course facilitators, using a specially created facilitator manual. An evaluation conducted in 2004 reported that as a result of attending the sessions, participants: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Were better able to deal with stress and anger &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Has more gender equitable views on family roles and responsibilities and political participation, and were more likely to support equitable treatment for girls and boys in education, work, dress and marriage &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Had increased knowledge on family planning and modes of HIV transmission &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Displayed more positive attitudes on gender based violence and female genital mutilation, although some traditional views were retained &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper, prepared by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), highlights the major energy challenges that countries in the south and south west Asia sub-region are facing. It explores the linkages between energy and sustainable development, in particular the relevance of energy resources to poverty alleviation, gender equity, provision of education and health services, and protection of the environment. The report argues that the absence of lifeline energy is a dimension of economic deprivation, which exacerbates social vulnerabilities and inequalities. On the basis of a detailed review of the energy and sustainable development landscape, the report identifies five core areas where the countries of the sub-region can collaborate: improved utilisation of unequally distributed energy resources; establishment of energy infrastructure; addressing the challenge of energy access; promotion of renewable energy and efficient energy use; and the creation of sub-regional energy markets. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change is one of the most important issues to tackle this generation and possibly any generation in history. Bangladesh is a very low energy consuming country, it is pursuing a low carbon growth path, while building its resilience to climate change and reducing the risk of climate change, which represents national development. However, Bangladesh is one of the top 10 nations that are mostly vulnerable to climate change and by the end of the century, Bangladesh may be set to disappear under the waves. The government and non-governmental organizations have a key role to play. This study was carried out by employing a general review of literature on climate change, focusing on its effects in Bangladesh, and the results of specific research recently conducted by the author. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report provides a framework for the national implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) safeguards. These safeguards are needed to ensure effective implementation of REDD+ so that it does not inadvertently harm communities and ecosystems. The framework provides a roadmap for navigating some of the choices that will arise in REDD+ design and implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After providing context and definitions, the report explains the unique nature of the UNFCCC REDD+ safeguards. Consisting of only broad substantive and procedural goals, they remain flexible in terms of methodology and minimum requirements. This allows countries to take new, culturally-sensitive approaches with their own national safeguard systems. The remainder of the report is then split into three sections relating to the creation of a national system: goals, functions, and rules and institutions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report defines national REDD+ goals, with one suggestion being safeguards to provide a floor, below which protection for people and the environment cannot fall. The functions of the REDD+ safeguards regard the processes by which goals are achieved. Functions of a national system should cover anticipating risks, planning to avoid or mitigate risks and maximise opportunities, managing implementation, monitoring, and responding to positive and negative outcomes. The process of assessing, improving and creating rules and institutions is discussed. The report offers advice on the types of rules available and notes the need for all institutions involved to be transparent, participatory and accountable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the report, examples are highlighted from efforts to create and implement national REDD+ safeguard systems in Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico. Examples of civil society groups and communities participating in the formulation and implementation of safeguard principles are presented, as well as the various legislation efforts. The process for achieving representative institutions in these countries is complicated and has seen mixed results. The lesson from this is the need to systematically ensure full representation of the most vulnerable voices. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Papua New Guinea (PNG) has enjoyed several years of strong economic growth, driven largely by high commodity prices and supported by structural reforms and some sound macroeconomic policies. However, the growing opportunities and wealth have been skewed increasingly in favour of a small and largely urban-based segment of the population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current paper addresses this issue and finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;challenges which PNG faces include: ensuring that the recent higher economic growth rates are sustainable in the long term, and translating high economic growth into much more inclusive development than has prevailed to date&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the critical constraints encompass: weaknesses in governance and institutions, poor infrastructure, shortages of skilled human capital, and poor and unequal access to affordable and good-quality education and health services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Policy recommendations for the government are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;vigorously apply the new informal economy policy in main and provincial centers and rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;review public sector terms and conditions - an independent review of the public sector is required&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;provide access to microfinance and other financial services, and place major emphasis on generating employment opportunities, including in agriculture&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;undertake a major program for raising the status of women in society, to empower women to participate more fully in, and benefit from, the economy, politics, and decision making&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;form innovative partnerships with private sector investment and participation in the delivery of public goods&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;help expanding the roles of civil society and NGOs and enhancing their skills to better fill their roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In addition, the government is recommended to take measures to make competitive conditions prevail in PNG markets to enable consumers to secure a more efficient and wider range of services at affordable and more internationally comparable prices. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report reprersents some of the central questions that one cannot avoid when thinking about the future of learning in the Knowledge-Based Society (KBS). It also discusses trends and challenges that are expected to shape future learning in the knowledge-based society. There is a section on technological trends, in particular Information Society Technologies (IST), and a section on social trends and challenges, of which some are generic (e.g. ageing society) and others specific to learning and education. It also looks at ICT from the point of view of learning. It discusses what role ICT could play in these and other trends and challenges. It contains sections on innovative and potential ICT applications for learning and on learning to use ICT. The issue of social inclusion related to ICTenabled learning is also raised as it is seen as an important concern for the future of learning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

It develops a conceptual framework for and selects key indicators measuring ICT development, with a specific focus on information and communication technologies (ICTs) as pervasive technologies of global impact, wide application and growing potential. Also, it benchmarks levels of existing infrastructure connectivity, as well as measures of future potential and important determinants affecting countries' abilities to absorb, adopt and make use of these rapidly evolving technologies. The challenges in such a benchmarking exercise are manifold, in the selection of a representative set of indicators measuring the complex concept of technology development; in the “breadth versus depth” trade-off in the nature and number of these indicators; and in the integration of the results of benchmarking into policy analysis. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examines how climate change affects the livelihoods and natural resources of the Upper Mustang region in Nepal, with particular focus on climate change impacts on agriculture, livestock, rangeland, water resources and housing. The study's objectives were: to understand local people's perceptions of climate change; to assess changes in livelihood sources in the past 20 years; and to understand roofing problems. The study finds that the annual average temperature is increasing at the rate of 0.032, whereas the total yearly precipitation trend is decreasing at the rate of 1.81. Survey responses indicate that the majority of local people believe that the temperature is increasing; almost 82 per cent of the total number of respondents said that the amount of snowfall had drastically decreased in last 20 years. Climate change consequences identified in the study include increased diarrhoea, water scarcity, increased dryness in rangelands and leaching problems in mud roofed houses. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture is an important economic sector in Honduras, where rural poverty and food insecurity are high. One-third of the population lives on smallholder farms growing staple crops such as maize and beans. Climate hazards already damage crops and infrastructure, leading to income loss and food insecurity, and climate change will exacerbate this situation. The capacity of smallholders to adapt to this additional stress is limited due to low levels of income and education and to environmental degradation. This report presents results of a climate risk and risk management capacity assessment of smallholder agriculture in Honduras, conducted as part of the Climate Risk Management Technical Assistance Support Project of the United Nations Development Programme. The project identified a range of interventions to support smallholder agriculture in Honduras, including improved local governance and social organisation, climate-proofing infrastructure and strengthened climate data management. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Population growth &amp; the increasing number of people seeing the relevance of education as well as demand for tertiary education in Ghana have been on the rise yearly. Tertiary institutions have been unpleasantly turning away large numbers of qualified applicants due to lack of facilities. To solve some of these problems in the tertiary educational sector of Ghana, the use of ICT through E-Learning have a major role to play. This paper discusses and elaborates the importance of E-Learning in the tertiary educational sector of Ghana as well as the different issues concerned in the implementation of an E-Learning System. The study also shows how ICT through E-Learning has helped or can help people access tertiary education by not necessarily being on the campus of the respective tertiary institutions. E-learning can be seen as a solution to the various factors that affect access to tertiary education such as lack of facilities to meet increasing educational demand due to population growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Building on a literature review (see EXPGOV Deliverable 3) and consultations with various stakeholders and experts, and in particular representatives of city governments, the document proposes a discussion on relevant theoretical orientations in order to further elaborate a preliminary conceptual framework for the development of a measurement framework to
assess policy impacts of ICTs on governance systems at city level. This document should therefore be read as a working paper to be further finalized after discussion with representatives of cities, other experts and researchers. The document will also serve to set the basis for further implementation of the EXPGOV exploratory research, conducted by IPTS in collaboration with cities within the framework of the Knowledge Society Forum of EUROCITIES. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Drawing on Latin American experiences of the challenges of extractive projects in resource-rich land (social unrest, conflict), this Brief outlines three successively implemented policy packages that have strengthened indigenous peoples’
cultural, territorial and consultation rights, recognising them as key stakeholders and partners in sustainable extractive
development. In particular, this Brief discusses how the recognition of these rights has supported conflict management
efforts, outlines the challenges that remain, and describes the broader social contexts that have framed these processes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Digital governance in developing countries may seem to be a distant thought for many but it is certainly making its presence felt, and in a form which is different from that evident in the developed countries. The growing use of ICT is catalysing the formation of knowledge societies, and thus providing greater avenues to people to participate in their own development process. The transformations occurring are unique and unprecedented in many ways and have the potential to reach those who hitherto have been marginalised from the decision-making processes. The inhabitants of knowledge societies will be more informed about the socio-economic and political processes which affect them and will be empowered to voice their concerns, and make informed decision on how they would like to be governed and by whom. We are entering into a brave new world where it will not be the leaders who govern people but it is the people who will let the leaders govern them. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), in the last decades countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama and Paraguay have designed and created electronic platforms that make information about procurement and government officials’ personal assets public.

    <dcterms:abstract>This communique from the African Women's Regional Civil Society Consultation on the Post 2015 Development Framework conveys a collective desire for a re-orientation toward issues perceived to have been neglected by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite significant achievements accomplished by the MDGs, there is concern that qualitative aspects of these achievements have received too little focus. Additionally, areas such as climate change and peace and security have been excluded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document notes that Africa is advancing well economically, but that women's rights must be expanded in areas beyond economic growth, such as structural social inequalities. It then goes on to make a number of recommendations for all actors to accelerate the existing MDGs. These cover a wide range of issues, including: prioritising reproductive health provision to marginalised groups such as rural women, sex workers, women with disabilities, etc; increasing freedom of expression and access to transparent information; the eradication of re-canonicalization of extractive industries and land; and ensuring government accountability and responsibility on women's rights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The communiqu&amp;eacute; offers five recommendations for the post 2015 development framework: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Education - ensure accessible and universal education, with a focus on eliminating barriers that limit the retention of girls through gender-sensitive policies, facilities and curriculum.

    <dcterms:abstract>Malnutrition in Nigeria has been identified as a major constraint to development.The proportion of households and individuals that are both malnourished and food insecure has been on the increase, with. children, women, and the elderly being mostly affected. To reduce the scourge of malnutrition, there is a need to build partnership among various stakeholders namely, the government, organized private sector, civil society, academia, local NGOs, international development partners, and donors. There must be a dynamic balance between policies and actions. The basic objective of the National Plan of Action on Food and Nutrition (NPAN) in Nigeria is to set strategies and projects for improving the nutritional status of all Nigerians with specific emphasis on the most vulnerable groups. The activities enumerated therein are expected to lay a solid foundation for improved productivity and development in the country. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>It is true that liberalisation of service sectors will generate efficiency in many domestic service sectors, and export opportunities for some of the services sectors will be increased. But, it should be noted that these opportunities through trade liberalisation are often theoretical and potential in nature (e.g., the World Bank estimates hints about benefit of developing countries from services trade, which is mentioned above). However, the danger of jeopardising the domestic economy through unplanned liberalisation is real. Under the GATS there are 11 broad categories of services, covering 160 sub-sectors. As the substantive negotiations for liberalisation of services sector are still ahead, it is important for each country to understand the pros and cons of liberalisation of services sector not as a whole, but sector by sector, which requires extensive exercise. Furthermore, other than importance of market access negotiations the negotiations on rules and market access under the GA &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Despite the rapid increase in FDI flows to LICs, there have been relatively few studies that have specifically examined these flows. The paper looks at BRIC FDI to LICs with a special focus on Chinese FDI to sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, and aims to broadly assess its macroeconomic impact using case studies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that official data sources undoubtedly underestimate the volume and scope of FDI flows as many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not always register their investment. As a result, while it is difficult to estimate accurately the growth impact of BRIC FDI, there is case study evidence that it is increasingly significant. While initial investment, mostly by state-owned companies, has often been destined for natural resource industries, over time, investment has been spreading to agriculture, manufacturing, and service industries (e.g., telecommunications). Therefore FDI from BRICs flows into many non resource-rich countries in LICs and plays a significant role in growth in those countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Researchers have long been interested in the potential of ICTs to enable positive change in developing regions communities. In these environments, ICT interventions often fail
because political, social and cultural forces work against the changes ICTs entail. Authors argue that familiar uses of ICTs for information services in these contexts are less potent than their use for persuasion and motivation in order to facilitate change. Authors focus on India’s rural maternal health system where health workers are employed in villages to persuade pregnant women to utilize health services. Health workers face challenges due to resistance to change in the village, and because of their limited education, training and status. These factors appear to reduce the motivation of health workers and impair their performance. This papers talks about the solutions of the fundamental challenges at grassroot level &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Malnutrition causes long-term damage to children&amp;rsquo;s development, with huge social and economic costs. It affects not only children&amp;rsquo;s physical development but also their cognitive development, so reducing future productivity and leading ultimately to economic loss for the nation as a whole. India has recorded strong economic growth in recent years but has shown little progress in tackling malnutrition. It is evident that economic growth alone will not solve the malnutrition problem and sustaining growth will require human capital development. Young Lives research suggests that there has been very little improvement over the last decade in children&amp;rsquo;s nutritional status and demonstrates the impact of malnutrition on children&amp;rsquo;s later development. Strengthening services and social protection schemes such as Integrated Child Development Services, the Public Distribution System and the Midday Meal Scheme are important elements of securing better nutrition for children and will support progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Analysis of Young Lives data offers a number of challenges to prevailing assumptions about orphans&lt;br /&gt;and vulnerability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;despite its high rate of economic growth, India is home to the largest number of malnourished children in any one country in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;malnutrition has long-term consequences for children. Stunting caused by malnutrition in early life is linked to many child development indicators (including literacy, self-confidence and educational aspirations).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Young Lives research shows that the problem of stunting has become increasingly concentrated in the poorest households.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;high food prices can have both short- and long- term effects on children&amp;rsquo;s nutritional status. Government policies can buffer families from these shocks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;programmes such as the Public Distribution Scheme help ensure food security for families but need to be strengthened. &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>Private sources of financing have become a growing feature of UN budgets. This report argues that an evaluation of the private financing of UNDP activities reveals both advantages - increased resources, more technical expertise, better management - and challenges such distorted priorities, unhealthy competition, weakened multilateralism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The increase in non-core funding constitutes a permanent change in the development scene. The UN continues to play a vital role in delivering programs with the use of such funds. It is a standard bearer for international treaties and principles; its universality means legitimacy; it adds value through its large network of offices and administrative capacities; and its perceived neutrality facilitates access to a range of partners in different country contexts. These advantages help explain the attraction of the UN system for delivering programs with resources from new funding sources. Hitherto, few other organizations have been able to perform this role. However, this role cannot be taken for granted, particularly with the emergence of new global organizations in the public, charitable, and for - profit sectors. Working with these funds has brought much benefit to the UN&amp;rsquo;s development work but also carries risks. As these changes are here to stay, it is essential that the UNDP and other vital organisations of the UN system find ways of optimising the use of these resources without diminishing their core purpose and values. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper shows that assumptions derived from the classical social contract theorists frequently lead the international community astray as it attempts to rebuild a number of African states. The paper illustrates that the historical social contract for most Africans is not between the state and individuals but with communities. However, the classical concept of the social contract causes us to think of bonds of legitimacy between the state and a citizenry of individuals. In this respect, the focus of the classical social contract on individuals leads to a liberal set of values that steer us away from the core issues needing attention in African conflicts. The document argues that Montesquieu&amp;rsquo;s liberty and the checks and balance offered by a focus on groups offers a more promising path in state reconstruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it suggests the following conclusions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;local systems of governance and the resolution of their problems are key to the restoration of order &amp;bull; the severe resource constraints created by violent conflict make international actors central to the imposition of some semblance of peace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the presence and importance of international actors in the networks changes policies and indirectly affects politics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;nevertheless, it does not threaten the integrity of the state as an institution itself, which instead is rooted in the processes of contracts with communities and 'bargains' with the military.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>Since 2001, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and academic institutions have implemented the Latin American Budget Transparency Index (Índice Latinomericano de Transparencia Presupuestaria - LABTI) to measure not only the accessibility of budget information, but also its usefulness. As a perceptions-based exercise, LABTI innovates by surveying not only budget specialists, but also the variety of stakeholders that use budget information. An exercise like this one allows governments to assess if the information they are publishing is useful, while also promoting citizen participation and creating a budgetary culture, and giving a variety of actors a tool to push for transparency reforms. This Brief describes the distinctive features of this index, concrete changes LABTI has achieved and the key factors underpinning the tool’s successful use, all in an effort to offer useful lessons learned for other contexts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This review of climate change legislation in 33 countries shows that developing countries are leading action on climate change. Overall, there has been significant progress in the climate and/or energy-related legislation of almost all major economies, but a great amount of the 2012 effort took place in emerging countries. In particular, among major economies Mexico and China are leading the action against climate change thanks to their recent steps to cut carbon emissions and raise energy efficiency. The study aims to support legislators advancing climate-related legislation by providing detailed information on existing legislation to help identify gaps, best practice and encourage peer-to-peer learning. It also hopes to provide positive momentum to the international climate change negotiations. According to the review, legislative action at the national level is a fundamental prerequisite to achieving global climate change mitigation goals. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Today, our medical education is still waiting at the crossroad for the long cherished reforms in curriculum and governance to meet the rapidly changing demands of the medical practice and to keep pace with explosions in information, new technology and innovations world over. The question is whether the knowledge, skill and values that our graduates learn to-day are in right balance to be the self-directed lifelong learners the committed physicians of 21st century? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper offers the authors&amp;rsquo; reflections on the post-2015 development framework, including the strengths and weaknesses of the MDGs, what has changed since 2000, and the challenges of the post-2015 period. While the MDGs helped people to hold their governments to account, they had a range of weaknesses which are listed by the authors. Some of these weaknesses were that they became linked to aid conditionality, they paid no attention to the unpaid economy, and they reduced the gender equality goal to parity in educational enrolment, women&amp;rsquo;s share of seats in parliaments and share on non-agricultural employment. The paper goes on to set out the key international and national changes since 200, which include many developing countries becoming middle income countries and some becoming donors, the global financial crisis, and the weakening of women&amp;rsquo;s rights due to claims that they are at odds with traditional cultural values. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper argues that the post-2015 framework must not be just a continuation of the MDGs, which make no reference to macroeconomic policies. It must seek to design macroeconomic policies that support the realisation of human rights. The authors discuss some alternative understanding of development that have been put forward, including human development, inclusive growth and sustainable development. They explain why none of these are sufficient, and that any new understanding of development needs to be framed in terms of social justice, articulated in terms of human rights norms. Instead of the current MDG 3 on gender equality and women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment, made up of weak indicators, gender issues should be discussed in terms of women&amp;rsquo;s rights, the paper states. It finishes by discussing indicators for post-2015 development, noting that they should not be detached, stand alone targets, but rather indicators of the conduct of policy processes and of the extent of rights being realised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly important in achieving development goals and promoting citizen participation. Zambia is one of a number of countries in the Southern African region that have sought to include ICTs in their national development plans. This policy brief summarises a review of the successes and failures of this approach in Zambia, and considers the next steps that are needed to meet the information and communication needs of the coming generation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, medical education in developed and developing countries has undergone profound changes to keep pace with advancing public health needs and challenges. To reorient medical education in the South-East Asian Region, the adoption of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) Global Standards in Medical Education was emphasized. A significant number of reports by national and international organizations also suggested strategies for direction to such changes. In Bangladesh, a community-oriented and competency-based undergraduate medical curriculum was implemented in 2002 with an aim to produce need-based doctors for the community. However, it was felt necessary that there should be an ongoing evaluation of the curriculum to make it more responsive to community health needs. This study was designed to investigate the opinions of medical teachers on the present status of implementation of undergraduate curriculum of Bangladesh in selected private medical colleges. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of the policies, narratives, operational modalities and underlying motivations of Brazilian and Chinese development cooperation in Mozambique. It is particularly interested in understanding how the engagements are perceived and talked about, what drives them and what formal and informal relations are emerging at the level of particular exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on three experiences representing a variety of engagements and suggesting the increasingly blurred motivations shaping cooperation encounters: (i) ProSavana, Brazil’s current flagship programme in Mozambique, which aims to transform the country’s savannah land spreading along the Nacala corridor, drawing on Brazil’s own experience in the Cerrado; (ii) the Chinese Agricultural Technology Demonstration Centre (ATDC) in the outskirts of the Mozambican capital; (iii) a private Chinese rice investment project in the Xai-Xai irrigation scheme, which builds on a technical cooperation initiative. The conclusion discusses the extent to which observed dynamics on the ground suggest the emergence of distinctive patterns of cooperation and identities issues for further research on Brazilian and Chinese engagements in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper takes a broad overview of the issues of gender and ICT from a policy-making perspective. The specific objective of this paper is to provide a systematic framework for incorporating gender issues in ICT policy documents. This framework is designed to serve as a toolkit that can be used by policy-makers, researchers and advocates to evaluate the “gender-sensitivity” of ICT policy documents. The framework attempts to identify the deficiencies in addressing gender issues in the following areas: communication infrastructure, public access to ICTs, applications in e-Government, e-Commerce, e-Health and e-Education, women entrepreneurship in ICT sector, equitable capacity building for developing ICT applications, and ICT-based means of capturing public opinion. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper discusses various issues related to ICT in library with respect to current digital era. Library and Information Services (LIS) are being transformed by technology and they have to adapt to these changes to meet their users’ changing needs and growing expectations. Rapidly developing information and communication technology are creating new opportunities and challenges for traditional libraries. The new trend world over is to move towards digital collection. Existing libraries are busy digitizing their traditional collections via online subscriptions and planning, design, deployment and ongoing operations management and technical support of and ICT infrastructure. (“ICT” is an acronym for “Information and Communication Technology”) Information and Communication Technology infrastructure and the library personnel comprise two critical resources required for digital library projects. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article considers policy practice in the Arab region, highlighting some key areas for consideration in future policy making in the region. The peoples&amp;rsquo; revolutions and uprisings in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Libya have, the author argues, brought to the surface the need to better understand the relationships between people&amp;rsquo;s right to development and political governance, social and economic policies. In previous decades, national development was neglected as those in power sought to gain international support by adopting orthodox economic policies. This resulted, the article argues, in growth that did not promote people&amp;rsquo;s economic and social rights. Nor did it help to achieve women&amp;rsquo;s rights or to meet goals on equality. Now, the challenge in Arab countries is to rebuild a national development strategy. This must include a focus on women&amp;rsquo;s civic, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and this focus must be an integral part of the development of policies, not a separate or piecemeal project. The author argues that women&amp;rsquo;s rights groups in the region must work together with other civil society actors to ensure that the reforms being implemented by states fully include the principles of human rights, non discrimination, justice and equality. This is especially important in a region where &amp;ldquo;multiple forms of violence and discrimination against women intensify the challenges facing the debate around alternative development paradigms&amp;rdquo; and women&amp;rsquo;s rights struggles are already facing a strong backlash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article goes on to call for a closer look at the growth policies that benefit women, and those that go further &amp;ndash; actually helping to tackle gender inequality. The sub sections that follow consider policies on production, investment and trade, and financial institutions. The article concludes by observing that post-revolution, governments, policy makers and civil society organisations increasingly refer to citizens&amp;rsquo; rights and use pro-poor rhetoric in their agendas. But it is essential for people to question whether this rhetoric is put into practice within economic and development strategies and policies, and whether women&amp;rsquo;s rights and social justice is prioritised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this study, 100% doctors used aneroid type sphygmomanometer. Ninety percent of apparatus were without error. Ninety six percent of the BP cuff was of standard size. Twenty two percent of the doctors did not let the patient rest before recording BP. None of them recorded BP in both arms. In outpatient setting, 70% recorded blood pressure in sitting position and 30% in supine position. In 44% patients where BP was recorded in sitting position BP apparatus was below the level of heart and 60% did not have their arm supported. Eighty four percent did not use palpatory method before checking the BP by auscultation. Sixty percent lowered the BP at a rate of more than 2 mm/s. Seventy six percent recorded BP only once and 75 % of the rest reinflated the cuff without completely deflating and allowing rest before a second reading was obtained. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study presents the summary of a cross-sectional anthropometric and mortality survey undertaken in eight states in northern Nigeria from 10th to 25th of December, 2010. The survey was conducted in Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara states from 3,325 households and 4,814 children under five years of age. The objective was to determine malnutrition prevalence. The prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) was found to be highest in Sokoto and Borno states at 12.6% and 5.1% respectively. Four out of the eight states reported GAM above 10%, with the upper confidence limit for all states except Borno above 10%. 21 cases of bilateral oedema were reported in the total sample. There was no case of marasmus and kwashiorkor (children with severe acute malnutrition and bilateral edema. Underweight was highest and lowest in Katsina and Borno at 44.9% and 24.9% respectively. Stunting was found to be generally above 50% &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is based on the assumption that libraries have a pivotal role to play in nation building, and future of libraries is in our own hands. It further emphasizes the need for change in libraries in the context of emerging knowledge economy. It makes reference to the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, UNESCO's Education for All Programme (EPAP), and Information for All Programme (IFAP), as well as the mandate of the National Knowledge Commission (NKC). It also highlights the impact of ICT on the life and work of people, and paradigm shift in libraries. It emphasizes that library consortia, institutional repositories, and
open access archives are strategic response to the paradoxical situation of growing digital documents and declining library budgets. It further explains that more important than the name of a library (traditional or digital) is the mandate and the context of the library. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Well-designed and targeted local Benefit Distribution Systems (BDS) are central to the success of REDD+. This report, based on experiences from Vietnam, provides an iterative process for the design of local level pro-poor approaches to BDS. At the centre of the approach are methods for ensuring the inclusiveness of local actors in decision-making around the benefit types and timing, and the need for local inclusion in governance frameworks. It advocates several key messages which aim to help shape a BDS that is consistent with the key principles used to define the pro-poor approach, including: pro-poor local BDS is not simply about paying cash to poor stakeholders; an assessment of existing land tenure arrangements will be a fundamental precondition to identifying beneficiaries; and monitoring performance and payments is critical. The report hopes to inform the future development of effective BDS in Vietnam. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Use of ICT for quality improvement also figures in Government of India's flagship programme on education, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). Again, ICT figured comprehensively in the norm of schooling recommended by Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), in its report on Universal Secondary Education, in 2005. With the convergence of technologies it has become imperative to take a comprehensive look at all possible information and communication technologies for improving school education in the country. The comprehensive choice of ICT for holistic development of education can be built only on a sound policy. The initiative of ICT Policy in School Education is inspired by the tremendous potential of ICT for enhancing outreach and improving quality of education. This policy endeavours to provide guidelines to assist the States in optimizing the use of ICT in school education within a national policy framework. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The newly independent Timor-Leste has established itself as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and the Pacific. This study examines the first decade of the restoration of independence to assess if Timor-Leste&amp;rsquo;s economic growth has been inclusive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author points that the concentration of economic activity in the capital has raised the concern that the better off members of society are capturing most of the benefits. However, the paper finds that opportunity has been provided to a larger share of the population, with those on lower as well as higher living standards enjoying more opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in Timor-Leste, opportunity generally increased across all living standard groups, including the poorest&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is evident that inequality in opportunity is generally in decline&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;inclusive growth overall is driven by improvements in education and health care &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;nevertheless, inequality is still high for some services (e.g. electricity), and access to some other services deteriorated (i.e. transport and improved sanitation) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author deems that inclusive growth has been achieved in Timor-Leste, but he emphasises that if the growth is to remain inclusive, it will be important to maintain the upward movement in average opportunity and the decline in inequality. Therefore, there will be a need to prioritise support for the poorest Timorese and achieve improvements in the lagging sectors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;within Timor-Leste, development is equated with access to basic services &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;minimum standards of service delivery are proposed as a safeguard for the poorest Timorese; this would reduce inequality and ultimately equalise the distribution of opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, such standards would put into practice the aspiration of the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011&amp;ndash;2030 of sustainable, inclusive development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study is a population-based cross-sectional observational study which aims to document the double burden of malnutrition and cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in adults in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso and its occurrence according to different socio-demographic parameters. In each income stratum, 110 individuals aged 25-60 years who had lived permanently in the area were randomly selected. Anthropometric, socio-economic and clinical data were collected. The overall obesity/overweight prevalence was 24.2% which was twice as high in women as in men. Hypertension, hyperglycaemia, low HDL cholesterol and metabolic syndromme prevalence was 21.9%, 22.3%, 30% and 10.3% respectively. Iron depletion and vitamin A deficiency affected 15.7% and 25.7% of participants respectively, with higher rates in women. CMRF are becoming a leading nutritional problem in adults of Qugadougou, while nutritional deficiencies persist. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A practical, disciplined approach that increases capacity and optimizes resources has moved beyond its pilot phase and is scaling successfully. In Nigeria, mobile healthcare teams armed with innovative, appropriate ICT expand healthcare capacity and increase healthcare delivery to underserved rural and urban areas and boost disease reporting rates. Since the pilot phase proved effectiveness and efficiency by increasing patients seen by 270% and disease reporting by 900%, it’s been successfully scaled to include more mobile teams, more communities, more primary healthcare clinics, more hospitals, and more trained clinicians—now reaching over 400 communities and expanding to 113 Local Government Areas. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The first cases of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were reported in United States in 1981. AIDS appeared in Bangladesh 8 years later. At present AIDS exists worldwide. Neighboring countries like India, Myanmar and Thailand already have alarming rates of HIV infection. With increasing incidence and prevalence of AIDS worldwide, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants and children are also increasing. In developed countries, paediatric AIDS constitute only 2% of HIV infection, where as in developing countries, it comprises about 20% of all the HIV infected cases. Areas like Africa, where HIV is endemic and heterosexual transmission predominates, have a devastating high frequency of paediatric AIDS cases1. In contrast to adults the course of HIV infection in children is accelerated, the phases are less distinct and progression from one phase to another is rapid resulting in early death. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This publication contains 12 case studies, which illustrate the transformational role of ICT in villages. I hope the men and women who have mastered the technologies and are applying them in day today life will serve as role models for other rural families. We should convert the small programme started by MSSRF in 1992 into a mass movement, bringing hope and cheer in the lives of the rural poor. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The courts are one of the most fundamental institutions where power is contested in a constitutional democracy. A functioning and an independent judiciary can restrain and hold the executive accountable together with other state institutions, as well as political and economic elites. A robust judiciary is imperative in establishing rule-based governance. In November 2007, the subordinate judiciary in Bangladesh was formally separated from the executive by bringing in force the main findings of the case of Masdar Hossain. In this context, the Institute of Governance Studies (IGS), by way of this Policy Note, aims to provide a number of policy recommendations, which could further strengthen the independence of the judiciary. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The BRICS countries have been lauded for their economic growth and resilience through the 2008/09 financial crisis; they are becoming models of development for development practitioners, researchers and other emerging economies. But most of these countries have seen enormous increases in income inequality – specifically China, India and South Africa (Brazil has enjoyed a reduction.) What can be learnt, in terms of the challenges and successes of reconciling growth and equity, from the BRICS’ recent growth? This paper examines the experiences of four of the BRICS – Brazil, China, India and South Africa – and identifies four key factors shaping the countries’ pattern of growth: people having access to assets; investment in productive activities; social transfers; and a political economic context where inclusion is a priority. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wendy Harcourt delivered this keynote address at the UN Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) Vienna Policy Dialogue, the aim of which was to make policy recommendations for more effective and coherent international cooperation to achieve gender equality in the post-2015 development agenda. In her address, Harcourt highlights major threats to gender equality posed by the current context; then she talks about the strategic narrative points for participants to thread together themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest threat that she sees is carrying on with &amp;lsquo;business as usual&amp;rsquo;, which is not working. She emphasises the need to look at the underlying problems that are causing increasing inequalities and the crises we are facing, and to recognise that the world has changed in ways that the old MDG framework cannot address. &lt;br /&gt;Harcourt names three ways in which the world has changed and is challenging business as usual:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The BRICS are powerful countries that do not have the same colonial narrative and history as that which formed the OECD development agenda of today. The OECD is also a very different player now on the global stage as it faces its own internal crises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. New types of political citizens, netizens, hold promise for new forms of governance, citizenship and democracy. There are questions regarding how they will engage in the development agenda, and what kind of gender equality is informing their organising. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Amidst of numerous crises (climate, energy, etc.), there is general agreement that the sustainable development debate needs to be revisited, and that sustainability must be at the core of the post 2015 agenda. Questions as to how this will be done include the incorporation of non-Western knowledge and the participation of women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the discussion threads Harcourt names are that patriarchal patterns and gender inequalities are replicated from the most micro to the most macro levels. Masculinity in development must be part of the gender equality agenda. Also, we need to answer why there is a lack of adherence to the agreed human rights frameworks. She says that one answer may be the reductionism of the MDGs, which &amp;ldquo;missed the insights of those agreed norms&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional information: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a series of consultations in preparation of the 2014 DCF, the Vienna Policy Dialogue brought together senior representatives, experts from national and local governments, civil society organisations, parliaments, women&amp;rsquo;s organisations and the private sector with representatives of international organisations. &lt;br /&gt;For more information, visit the UN webpage for the Vienna Policy Dialogue on Gender Equality: http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/newfunct/dcfviennadialogue.shtml &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Ample research is conducted on ICT, automation and robotics in agriculture and related environmental issues. ICT and Robotics innovations are rapidly emerging and have the ability to revolutionize future farming through their major impacts on productivity and profitability. Unfortunately human and financial resources and efforts are fragmented and limited. This led to the creation of the ICT-AGRI ERA-NET that provides a central structured framework. Its main objective is to strengthen and coordinate European research regarding ICT and robotics in agriculture. Besides the creation of the Meta Knowledge Base (MKB), a common European research agenda will be developed and common research calls are launched. The Meta Knowledge Base (http://db-ictagri.eu) is attempting to map all relevant research and development within the selected research area. To accomplish the mapping, two types of information are collected: research profiles and research postings. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Over the years, the many people involved in this sector have gathered an enormous wealth of implicit knowledge on how these organisations work, how they relate to each other and how they develop themselves. This publication captures some of their practices and will make their organisational lessons learnt more explicit. Making these lessons more accessible will support practitioners who are involved in one way or another in the development of LGBTI organisations, whether they be activists, funders, capacity enhancers, networkers, programmers, lobbyists or whichever other role or combinations of roles. After reading (parts of) this publication, the reader will hopefully feel inspired, enlightened, challenged, disturbed or motivated. Any of these feelings, in combination with the lessons learnt and the tips and tricks in this publication, will hopefully trigger further positive change in the LGBTI entity, organisation or movement in or with which they are involved. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Considering the rapidly expanding adaptation portfolios in most international cooperation institutions, there is a need to support project managers, particularly in designing and monitoring projects focussing on climate change adaptation. This guide by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&amp;uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is aimed at government representatives, donors and non-governmental organisations involved in planning and implementing adaptation projects. It is also intended as a reference source for national and international organisations, NGOs and research bodies that require a practical framework for the results-based design of adaptation interventions and verification of the results achieved. The guide is divided into three parts: an introduction; a practical part explaining the recommended step-by-step approach to designing an adaptation project and setting up its monitoring system; and a summary. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The war in Syria is currently in a particularly complex phase with conflicting reports of rebel progress. Jihadist militias are growing in strength and capability, making it probable that they will have considerable influence and even power in a post-Assad Syria. At the same time, there are indications that elements supporting the Assad regime, including the Iranian government, recognise this and are planning for the aftermath with their own militias. This paper looks at the latest developments in an increasingly complex conflict. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In contemporary world, community participation is considered as the prerequisite of sustainable urban development. It ranges from just informing people about the plan or development projects by the people. However, public participation in local government’s led
programs is still limited in Bangladesh. Considering the importance of community participation, this paper explores the level of public participation in spatial planning practices in Khulna city based on the citizen’s responses. The study suggests that existing legislative arrangement is not supportive for participatory urban development at all levels and a little provision is made in this respect by laws. Most of the respondents in the field survey
suggested that political problem and weak communication mechanism are mainly responsible for unsuccessful implementation of the Master Plan of Khulna city. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mobile technologies are increasingly growing in developing countries like India. There have been several new researches and developments in this space. Nowadays mobile is becoming an important ICT tool not only in urban regions but also in remote and rural areas. The rapid advancement in the technologies, ease of use and the falling costs of devices, make the mobile an appropriate and adaptable tool to bridge the digital divide. Mobile phone ownership in India is growing rapidly, six million new mobile subscriptions are added each month and one in five Indian's will own a phone by the end of 2007. By the end of 2008, three quarters of India's population will be covered by a mobile network. Many of these new "mobile citizens" live in poorer and more rural areas with scarce infrastructure and facilities, high illiteracy levels, low PC and internet penetration. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A good higher education system is required for overall prosperity of a nation. A tremendous growth in the higher education sector had made the administration of higher education institutions complex. Many researches reveal that the integration of ICT helps to reduce the complexity and enhance the overall administration of higher education. This study has been undertaken to identify the various functional areas to which ICT is deployed for information administration in higher education institutions and to find the current extent of usage of ICT in all these functional areas pertaining to Information administration. The various factors that contribute to these functional areas were identified. A theoretical model was derived and validated. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The report covers factors including: Islamist terrorism; criminal networks and trafficking (of arms, drugs, cigarettes, and vehicles); and Tuareg rebellions against the Malian government. It also considers state weakness, including the weakness of state security structures in the north, and the role of neighbouring countries, ECOWAS, the AU and other international actors. Practical recommendations in the literature include: 

Adopt a burden-sharing and a multi-tiered approach that builds on the strengths of different actors. 
Support livelihoods and integrate Tuareg concerns over land and livelihood opportunities through inclusive political engagement. 
Seek to weaken incrementally the criminal networks in Mali's north through coherent international support for regional cooperation. 
Establish a common position on ransom payments.
Consider joint anti-terrorism and development policies aiming to strengthen the state's operational capacity to deliver security and development. 
Draw on traditional conflict-management mechanisms, such as inter-community and inter-clan solidarity systems. 
Be sensitive to historical tensions between the Hausa and Tuareg ethnic groups. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report shows why gender differences exist in the ICT industry and makes recommendations on how this might be addressed. In particular, it is crucial that we work together to address misguided perceptions of the ICT industry; we must help young people to see the excitement of this dynamic and fast-evolving sector.

Europe needs more "cyberellas" – women equipped with the e-Skills needed for the future. These skills are key to ensuring Europe retains a major role in the ICT sector of tomorrow. To tap this vast pool of talent, special attention must be paid to raising the participation of women
in this field. I therefore warmly welcome collaboration with industry to ensure we open girls’ minds to the opportunities that are there for
them within the ICT sector. It is fundamental not only that no one is left behind but that the sector benefits from increased diversity and productivity gains that have been demonstrated to come from a better balance of women in top jobs and technical &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This book is a contribution to the field of gender and ICTs for development and is unique for two reasons. First, the collection of papers in this volume builds on a wider initiative of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) in the Netherlands to compile state-ofthe-art knowledge on Gender, Society and Development. Knowledge that informs policy and advocacy is critical to overcoming poverty which is directly linked to economic and social justice for all. At an alarming rate, women, relative to men, are experiencing higher rates of hunger and malnutrition, illiteracy, overwork and sexual violence with direct impacts on children, the sick and the elderly under their care. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This working paper explores some of the drivers and challenges affecting countries’ climate compatible development (CCD) policy processes and their incentives for engaging on this agenda. The paper argues that there is not a straightforward relationship between CCD policies and outcomes such as growth, poverty and equity. There will be winners and losers, and trade-offs among social, economic and environmental goals and between long-term and short-term benefits. This makes the political and institutional dimensions of CCD particularly challenging. According to the paper, understanding and managing the political economy of CCD is essential to promoting and strengthening climate compatible development outcomes and overcoming barriers to implementation. In addition to outlining some of the key drivers and challenges of CCD strategies, the paper provides possible solutions to overcoming the identified barriers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document contains World Bank Group's ICT strategy. The Strategy is based on three different pillars: Innovate: Developing competitive IT-based service industries and fostering ICT innovation across the economy â€“ with a focus on job creation, especially for women and youth. Connect: Scaling up affordable access to broadband â€“ including for women, disabled citizens, disadvantaged communities, and people living in remote and rural areas. Transform: Making development more open and accountable, and improving service delivery â€“ for instance, education, health, and financial services. The strategy, in essence, emphasizes the opportunities that a functional ICT sector creates in terms of development impact. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Sub-Saharan Africa is facing a rapid increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Previous and ongoing undernutrition among pregnant women may contribute to this development as suggested by epidemiological studies from high income countries linking undernutrition in fetal life with increased burden of non-communicable diseases in later life. A cohort study was conducted in June, 2009, in Enugu, Nigeria. Adults (n = 1,339) born before (1965–67), during (1968–January 1970), or after (1971–73) the years of famine were included. Blood pressure (BP), random plasma glucose (p-glucose) and anthropometrics, as well as prevalence of hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and were compared between the three groups. Fetal and infant undernutrition was associated with significantly increased risk of hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance in 40year-old Nigerian. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are electronic tools used to convey, manipulate and store information. The exponential growth of Internet access and ICTs greatly influenced social, political, and economic processes in the United States, and worldwide. Regardless of the level of practice, ICTs will continue influencing the careers of social workers and the clients they serve. ICTs have received some attention in the social work literature and curriculum, but we argue that this level of attention is not adequate given their ubiquity, growth and influence, specifically as it relates to upholding social work ethics. Significant attention is needed to help ensure social workers are responsive to the technological changes in the health care system, including the health care infrastructure and use of technology among clients. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>ICTs have been drawn into the ‘development’ field as potential tools for poverty alleviation and economic and social development. There is not, however, a single accepted definition of ‘development’ in ICT for development (ICT4D) projects. The lack of a single definition has implications for the design, implementation, and evaluation of ICT4D initiatives. Our goal in this paper is to problematize ‘development’ in these projects. Based on our analysis of Indian rural kiosk initiatives, we argue that variations in institutional definitions of development can lead to different strategies for deployment and implementation of projects. We examine the different philosophies of development and project goals of three ICT4D kiosk initiatives, including projects initiated by a nonprofit organization (Datamation Foundation), a private business (n-Logue), and a state public-private partnership in Kerala (Akshaya). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Effective school leadership is a basic tenet for successful school since the outcome of a school depends on the quality of leadership. As a current popular form of leadership, distributed leadership focuses on the leadership of all team members in a school. Research shows that successful leadership depends on the context and time of a school. This paper tries to conceptualize distributed leadership in Bangladesh context during the time of their education restructuring. Though distributed leadership is seldom discussed and operated in developing countries, it advocates the implementation in those contexts due to the continuous success of it in the developed world. Hence, this conceptual paper discusses the possibilities and the potential problems in relation to implement this leadership form for the reforming education sector of Bangladesh. Prior to this, the theoretical background of distributed leadership has been considered in this article. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Norwegian Government funded REDD+ project portfolio in Tanzania is creating significant positive results across the country. 
Along with the participation of multiple institutions in the nationally anchored research project on climate change, an important foundation for Tanzania’s future REDD activities, is being developed.
The mid-term review covered a variety of key REDD issues such as governance and land-tenure issues, incentives for communities to participate in projects, and baseline assessment and participatory carbon monitoring challenges.
The mid-term review was carried out during the period June-August 2012, by independent consultants, Deloitte. The findings, opinions and conclusions in the mid-term review reports are those of the consultants. All pilot partners have been given the opportunity to respond to the mid-term review reports in writing. These responses have been made available next to the consultant reports. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article on the GenderIT.org website provides an overview of four projects based in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that use Information Communication technologies (ICTs) to address issues of Violence against Women (VAW) and girls. The Association for Progressive Communications, Women&amp;rsquo;s Networking Support Programme (APC WNSP), provided small grants in 2010 of US$5,000 to community based organisations, in order to implement these projects and build organisational capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the projects work with female high school students, in the Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire areas using mobile phones to tackle sexual harassment. Both projects have involved bringing students together to identify and discuss what constitutes sexual harassment and violence against women, as well as raising awareness of relevant human rights and national laws. Information on these laws was sent out via text and competitions were held on the information shared. Text messaging has also allowed students and teachers to give testimonies in private.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Association Femmes Solidaires set up a project in Brazzavile training women infected and affected by HIV/AIDS and survivors of violence to counsel their peers via the Internet. From this a radio series has been produced sharing stories, experiences and advice on rights. Handicap&amp;eacute;s Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res work with women with disabilities in the Pointe-Noire region, and have set up two workshops addressing violence against women&amp;rsquo;s and girls&amp;rsquo; with disabilities. They have also provided training on basic internet skills and blogging amongst other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion the article draws out recommendations to be taken forward to CSW, including: the need for a free helpline dealing with calls related to violence against women and girls; need for funding and trainers who can make the link between ICTs and fighting violence against women and girls. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Despite increasing urbanisation in Asia countries, a large fraction of Asia&amp;rsquo;s poor remain in rural areas. This paper examines the potential for sector-specific productivity growth, human capital, credit markets, and infrastructure to contribute to the development of stable, well-paid employment in rural areas of low-income countries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relying mainly on data from India, the paper introduces the following findings:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;if landholdings are equally held and all workers are employed on their own farm, expansion in agriculture technology will increase household earnings; however, this model is unrealistic&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;for farmers that do not hold land, the earnings from agriculture depend on the wages that they receive, so if agricultural technology improvements result in increasing mechanisation, wages may fall&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;actually, non-farm earnings now approach almost half of all earnings of rural areas in developing countries, thus what happens to wages will depend critically on what happens to the non-farm sector &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in practice, non-farm sector can consist of small-scale farms selling services on the local market, and this sort of activity is expected to having an advantageous effect on agricultural wages&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, policies that promote migration, inclusive of improved schooling and better access to urban labour markets, may also have advantageous effects on rural employment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author concludes that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expansion in rural employment is likely to be most responsive to a broad spectrum of different interventions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;yet, special attention should be paid to how individual programs and effects affect the operation of local markets for products and labour and the broader connections of these markets to the wider world&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is reasonable to believe that value-added production in agriculture is a potentially valuable source of rural earnings growth &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;accordingly, more emphasis should be placed on increasing the production of goods that incorporate local agricultural products as inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This working paper, produced by the Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios (MAPS) programme, investigates the relationship between emissions, inequality and poverty in middle-income countries in Africa and Latin America. Research on this topic is of particular importance, since changing global demographics mean that the majority of the world's poor now live in middle-income countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that, with economic growth contributing to greater emissions, a trade-off appears between the two that decreases as a country&amp;rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) grows. Further analysis suggests that environmental degradation increases and then declines as GDP grows, but carbon emissions continue to grow with GDP. The relationship between inequality and emissions is also discussed; evidence suggests that in relatively equal societies, increased inequality correlates with decreased emissions, with the inverse suggested for countries of high inequality, i.e. lower inequality/lower emissions (shown on a graph as a shallow 'U'). The research suggests that there is an opportunity for the growing number of middle-income countries to both reduce emissions and combat poverty. However, only the most unequal poor countries could do likewise, because most would suffer a significant trade-off between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two case studies, South Africa and Brazil, are analysed to investigate the relationship between per capita emissions and inequality in middle-income countries. In Brazil, rates of emissions and inequality reflect the development and economic choices of successive governments. Until 1994, emission and inequality levels closely correlated, rising and falling together. Since then, GDP and emissions have grown, but redistributive social policies have seen inequality decrease. In South Africa, a long history of inequality founded on racial segregation has contributed to lack of reduction in inequality alongside economic growth, with per capita emissions remaining steady. With emissions largely concentrated in the coal-based energy sector, South Africa is well placed to design mitigation actions while continuing social policies aimed at poverty reduction and inequality. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This research paper examines the question, "Does information change lives?" by looking at the role of five small FM radio stations launched and managed by Internews, with funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The radio stations operate in a large territory that includes what is now South Sudan and the regions known as the Three Areas. The stations were established during the time of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which ended Sudan's long-running civil war in 2005 and led to the establishment of South Sudan as an independent state in July 2011. The major conclusion of this study is that there is enormous potential for media development in South Sudan because of the enthusiasm for and interest in news and information, even in the most remote villages. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A field experiment was conducted at the `Research Farm` of Regional Seed Production Office of Lal Teer Seed Limited, Dinajpur, Bangladesh during November 2008 to April 2009. The study was conducted to investigate the effect of bulb size and planting spacing on seed production of cultivarTaherpuri onion. Three bulb sizes [small (5±2g), medium (10±2g), and large (15±2g)] and four planting spacing [closest 25×15, closer 25×20, wider 30×15, and widest 30×20cm] was considered in this experiment. Number of flowering stalks, length of flowering stalks, number of umbels per plant, number seeded fruits, seed weight per umbel, 1000-seed weight and seed yield per hectare were measured to assess the onion seeds. The results revealed that the highest seed yield (776.67 kg) per hectare was obtained from the large bulb (15±2g) with the closest spacing of 25×15cm followed by small bulb size of same spacing. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This plans is focused on standardising government ICT. In the past, government departments worked to their own requirements and often procured expensive bespoke ICT systems and solutions to meet them. As a result, departments have been tied in to inflexible and costly ICT solutions which together have created a fragmented ICT estate that impedes the efficiencies created by sharing and re-use. It also prevents government from offering joined-up, modern, digitally-based public services that are suited to local requirements. Affordability in the current „age of austerity‟ requires a different approach. The approach set out in this plan ensures that departments will now work in a collegiate way, underpinned by rigorous controls and mandates. Strategy implementation is led by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Delivery Board, chaired by the Government CIO. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital problem in children. In order to avoid complications, reduce mortality and for proper management early detection of congenital heart disease is of utmost importance.Acyanotic heart diseases were commonly found both in past and present (75% and 78.5% respectively) and among them Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) was found the most common CHD (32.7% and 26.9% respectively). Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) was found 2nd most common CHD (25.6% and 21.2% respectively). Only 11.9% CHD were diagnosed during neonatal period in the past whereas 27.6% were diagnosed in the recent time. Rare CHD were detected more frequently in recent time. VSD is the commonest non-cyanotic lesion whereas TOF is the commonest cyanotic lesion both in past and present, though their frequency reduced than before. Early detection and detection of rare CHD during recent time may reflect the advancement of diagnostic skill and facilities as well as awareness. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Energy consumption is growing in developing countries at a great pace and improvements in energy efficiency (EE) could provide opportunity for economic growth while providing broader access to energy and related services even from limited energy resources. This report underlines that moving the developing world towards a low carbon economy requires a scaling up of financing for EE. It examines the current role of climate finance in funding EE projects and the potential to channel funds to relevant EE projects under the new Green Climate Fund. The report focuses primarily on public climate finance flows from North to South, probing the current use of funds from multilateral development banks, bilateral financial institutions and carbon markets for energy efficiency projects in developing countries. The report makes eight recommendations on the design of climate and sustainable energy finance programmes to ensure that EE projects are adequately funded by climate finance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Other than issues of duty free and quota free market access for non-agricultural products, Bangladesh also has strong interests in temporary movement of natural persons (TMNP). In this connection, LDC modalities adopted on September 3, 2003 provided ground for flexible and predictable negotiations under the GATS. 
In June 2004 member countries will meet in Geneva in two sessions of Council for Trade in Services. LDC Ministers are also meeting in Senegal in early May to discuss Singapore issues and other important relevant issues for LDCs. A meeting of LDC group is expected to take place in Geneva to advance WTO negotiations, where among others, services negotiations will get importance. 
This policy brief provides some specific inputs to the negotiations of Bangladesh’s government. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this mapping report is to give a comprehensive overview of the Nordic countries government’s discourse on the present and future opportunities related to the use of ICT within healthcare, security, the experience economy and traditional industry. More specifically the aim of the study is to identify visions, strategic rationales and reflections on future challenges within the four areas. The analysis is conducted as a desk-study, which means that only publicly available material on the
four subjects has been used. This material is mainly technological foresights, scenarios, and reports on visions and research for development strategies for the Nordic countries. This means that the material available not necessarily is representative of a given country’s political priorities and policies within a given area. The material reflects a focus on the area as such from the political level and an analysis of challenges and opportunities in the given area. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Forest certification schemes regulate forest exploitation and trade across many countries. In the absence of a multilateral agreement on limiting deforestation, they provide rules to balance the social, economic and ecological values of forest resources. Expansion of these schemes into tropical countries that display poor governance and high levels of corruption has raised questions about these schemes’ performance in such contexts. Referring to the case of the Forest Stewardship Council – a global forestry certification system – the authors looked at whether forest certification schemes can address corruption issues. While forest certification is not primarily geared towards detecting and preventing corruption, they may have some anti-corruption effects in countries where corruption is sporadic but not systemic. This is due to their role in documenting forest management practices and applying third-party monitoring. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has a very high population density. Scarce land and the rapid increase of population of the country are creating high pressure over land-man ratio. Land ownership record system is insufficient and incomplete in Bangladesh. As a result, it spills out jumbled and spontaneous land development throughout the country, especially in the major cities. In this situation, it is important to establish a compatible land administration and management system for establishing a systematic approach for planned land development. Land Information System (LIS) is the most accountable and feasible systematic approach for developing an up-to-date land administration and management. LIS is related to various quantitative and qualitative aspects of land resource. Holding different cartographic information, LIS facilitates capturing, retrieval, and querying of information and provides tools to perform different analyses. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this report, Nobel Peace Laureates Jody Williams and Rigoberta Mench&amp;uacute; Tum write that the levels of violence against women in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala have reached crisis dimensions. They describe their work leading a women&amp;rsquo;s rights fact-finding delegation that travelled to these countries in January 2012 to investigate the crisis. This investigation found many consistencies among women&amp;rsquo;s stories across the three nations (for example regarding sexual violence or forced disappearances), and noted inadequate government responses to these crimes &amp;ndash; the vast majority of cases are never even investigated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delegation was organised by the Nobel Women&amp;rsquo;s Initiative, JASS (Just Associates) and prominent national organisations that formed host committees in each country. Over the course of ten days, the delegation gathered evidence of the impact of escalating violence in the region on women and women&amp;rsquo;s rights, assessed the role and response of governments, and evaluated ways of supporting women who are organising to protect themselves and their communities. They gathered evidence and heard testimonies from over 200 women survivors of violence and human rights defenders from organisations working against violence, and also met with a number of government officials and representatives of international organisations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delegation concluded that the international community must urgently respond to the growing crisis of violence against women in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. They find the problem to have many causes, including increasingly militarised and patriarchal societies and current security policies supported by the US and Canadian governments, as well as the lack of justice and economic pressures in the region. &lt;br /&gt;The report includes a variety of recommendations including the following: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Pressure should be placed on the governments of the U.S. and Canada, Honduras, Mexico and Guatemala to ensure that they: uphold their responsibility to prevent violence and human rights violations; develop gender-sensitive mechanisms for protecting women human rights defenders; investigate complaints of human rights violations against women and women human rights defenders using established protocols for dealing with gender-specific violations; prosecute violations; and compensate survivors. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Violence against women and against women activists/human rights defenders, including the targeting of women human rights defenders should be publicly denounced and legal action demanded by diplomats, media and members of the international community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support for this women&amp;rsquo;s rights fact-finding mission was provided by a number of individuals as well as the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UN Women &amp;ndash; Latin American and Caribbean Section, and the MDG3 Fund and Funding Leadership Opportunities for Women (FLOW) of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This resource book by ActionAid International is for local level civil society practitioners who want to involve more people to make opinions and ideas heard at the local level - in elected local government and other state bodies, in civil society organisations, and in public spaces and media. It discusses how to ensure that democratic 'space' is created in ways that enable real influence for people living in poverty.

    <dcterms:abstract>Experience from Latin America shows how community consultation can be an important strategy used to manage conflict in Extractive Industries activities. This Brief characterises and analyses the different types of local consultation seen in the region, focusing on the diverse actors that lead the processes and providing illustrative examples of each. It also describes the main factors that made consultations more widespread in the region and that have improved their effectiveness. Finally, the Brief draws out lessons that could be useful for other regions aiming to establish or enhance their own community consultation processes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This policy report seeks to contribute to further development of measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) modalities and methodologies by providing conceptual clarification of MRV and outlining 16 case studies of MRV schemes. The concept of MRV is described as entailing multiple types, which should be distinguished to avoid conceptual confusion. The report identifies four MRV levels, which are all different in their purpose and nature: organisational, project, national and policies. Additionally, methodologies and experience at one level may not be immediately applicable at another level (for example, MRV methodology at the project level is not applicable at the policy level). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other key messages include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MRV needs to strike the right balance between simplicity and stringency depending on the context and objectives of the scheme. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Many Asian developing countries (notably China, India and Indonesia) are implementing policies to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many programmes and policies are put forward as nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) to seek international support, but some countries (such as China and India) are implementing domestic policies and measures. The quality of MRV processes attached to such policies is sometimes questionable in terms of data quality and practicality. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MRV requires technical capacities, as well as coordinating and research capacity to understand best practices. Capacity building activities in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia indicate the continued need for local government capacity building. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Improving the availability of basic data, such as default values, is critical to simplify MRV processes. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;MRV in cities should be an integral part of urban policies. However, these may not provide sufficient incentives for the city governments to implement robust city-level MRV and GHG emissions reduction. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To enhance community based MRV, local governments should develop supportive policies and benchmarks, including financial/technical assistance; and project partners must work closely with communities to develop local capacity for data development and collection in compliance with required criteria. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) can play an important role for MRV in waste and building sectors. LCA is a useful technique for GHG accounting and identifying the possible mitigation options throughout a product&amp;rsquo;s lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This analytical brief serves as a starting point for dialogue on water security in the United Nations system. Through this brief, UN-Water aims to capture the constantly evolving dimensions of water-related issues, offering a holistic outlook on challenges under the umbrella of water security. It highlights the main challenges to be addressed, the role water security plays in policy agendas and possible options for addressing water security challenges. The paper stresses that water security needs to be included in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG process must incorporate a goal and related targets for achieving water security, as this will address multiple priority development areas under consideration. The paper also argues that investment in water security is a long-term pay-off for human development and economic growth, with immediate visible short-term gains. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus is a regional economic agreement. This paper figures that the experience of negotiating a trade deal between this bloc and the EU alerted trade officials and civil society groups in the Pacific countries of the need to be better prepared next time around. Consequently, the paper presents an overview of how an informed and inclusive national dialogue can ensure wider appreciation of the different options for participation in PACER Plus discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document clarifies that it is time now for preparation as the Pacific states have agreed to commence PACER Plus negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key messages are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the Pacific officials need to commence a truly inclusive and well thought out national dialogue, and a coherent framework to engage, mediate and negotiate the different interests is required &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;concerned options need to be communicated in terms that do not alienate those not familiar with the technical trade jargon, so that each country can better determine the direction they want to take the talks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;national consultations will allow a fuller assessment of the opportunities and challenges under PACER Plus, but the prerequisite for this is the effective participation of all stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a national dialogue may not resolve the fundamental ideological differences that underpin the trade debate, but can be an effective consensus building tool (consensus is a typically Pacific way of decision making)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the process must be responsive and provide feedback to participants, and there needs to be a clear link to the policy and decision making processes with achievable results demonstrated for all to see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
However, the author stresses that there is no &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits all&amp;rdquo; framework to guide national consultations as each country has specific national interests as well as political, social and economic context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Globalization is viewed purely in its economic dimension-defined as increasing integration of a national economy with the world economy through exchange of goods and services, capital flows, technology, information and labour migration. It has become a rare opportunity to breakout the cycle of perennial poverty. More and more countries consider global economy as path to economic success. Multinational Corporations continue looking for new markets and low-cost production sites, and creating new opportunities for those countries to participate in the global economy. Bangladesh with her low economic profile has already aligned with the globalization process. A number of remarkable changes have been observed in the economic arena. Obviously, the potential benefits of globalization for Bangladesh are great. Increased access to capital inflow and technology, availability of goods and services at lower costs and employment opportunity are remarkable benefits for the economy of Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Species migrating across boundaries represent the classic case for international cooperation in biodiversity conservation. Climate change is adding new challenges to such cooperation, on account of the shifting ranges and particular vulnerabilities to climate change of migratory wildlife. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the present and potential future role of the main intergovernmental regime for migratory species conservation, the 1979 Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and its various daughter instruments, in respect of the adaptation of wildlife to climate change. It demonstrates that the CMS regime has taken significant first steps towards becoming a ‘climate-proof’ international wildlife conservation regime. At the same time, much potential remains for enlarging its contribution to ameliorating the impacts of climate change on migratory species conservation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper reviews the impacts of environmental degradation and climate change on hydropower generation in Malawi. Currently all of Malawi’s hydropower stations are run-of-river schemes cascaded along the Shire River with an installed capacity of nearly 280 MW. The generation is impacted negatively by floods, siltation, droughts and aquatic weeds infestation. The paper presents measures taken by the national electricity utility company to manage these impacts. It concludes that the hydropower generation system in a highly environmentally degraded area is difficult to manage both technically and economically. Therefore, the authors stress that it is important for Malawi to diversify its electricity generation sources, rather than relying solely on hydropower stations located in the Shire River. There is also a need for better flood control systems and local communities should be encouraged to take more active roles in environmental management programmes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Is there a difference between the current and the traditional value chains of staples in Asia? This study investigates how domestic staples value chains are structured and performing in three Asian countries (Bangladesh, China and India) in recent years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper clarifies that stakeholders of rice and potato value chains were surveyed in key rural producing centers that serve the large urban centers of the three economies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a transformational modernisation is under way in these staple food chains, albeit at different speeds &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;this transformation is a &amp;ldquo;quiet revolution,&amp;rdquo; as these changes are grassroots in nature&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;government&amp;rsquo;s roles have been important in enabling and at times providing incentives for the transformation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document concludes that value chain transformation is important to farmers&amp;rsquo; incomes, rural employment, and access to and affordability of staples for urban consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;harnessing the value chain transformation for food security should be front and center in the policy agenda of the 21st century &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a suite of policy and program measures is needed at various levels of the supply chain in order to stimulate the efficiency and competitiveness of expanding staples markets&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this context, a cluster of activities that supported various parts of the value chain in an integrated way is critical&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;yet, government strategies need to be tailored to widely different situations, and the provision of subsidised inputs should be reviewed and revised &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;remaining limitations on FDI (which is needed in logistics and retail) as well as unnecessary direct government intervention in the value chains should be reduced or eliminated &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a concerted public policy debate on how to get midstream and downstream businesses to invest in upgrading equipment and expanding activities is needed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper provides an overview of the nutritional situation in Africa and discusses brieﬂy some of the factors that inﬂuence nutritional status of the different groups of the population. Malnutrition in Africa is increasing due to various factors, some of which involve the changing global economic policies. Perspectives of globalization in relation to nutrition in Africa and the opportunities and challenges faced by nutritionists and relevant workers are presented. Globalization is affecting food and diseases patterns in Africa hence changing the scenario of the nutrition problems in Africa. Africa is now facing a double burden of having to deal with traditional under-nutrition and emerging over-nutrition in the ailing economies characterized by poor physical and information technology infrastructure,unskilled and unmotivated workers and increasing poverty. Therefore, Africa has a long way to go to be able to participate in the global economy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Information communication technologies (ICTs) can be used as a tool to stop violence against women (VAW), but VAW can also be facilitated through the use of ICTs. According to this paper, few women&amp;rsquo;s rights activists are working in this critical area and, as a consequence, most countries do to have a related political and legal framework. This paper aims to inform women&amp;rsquo;s rights groups working to end VAW, and stimulate action-oriented policy dialogues to address this new form of VAW. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document is divided into three parts, the first of which provides introductions to the basic topics covered in this paper and&amp;nbsp;discusses the intersections between ICTs and VAW. The second section is a case study of sexual violence and unauthorised distribution of intimate images of women. The third part contains conclusions and recommendations, which include the following: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; A holistic approach necessary to technology-related VAW, which should be facilitated through dialogue and research with a range of actors and issues. Spaces such as the Internet Governance Forum can provide a good platform for initiating such dialogue at the transnational level. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Civil society advocacy and initiatives (women's rights organisations and others) are important to ensure that women participate in policy-making dialogues, and that policy and law makers take ICT-related VAW into account. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; There is a scarcity of information on VAW, ICTs and the intersection between them. More systematic documentation of these violations is necessary to identify effective remedies and new policies. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Making online spaces safer: Internet intermediaries must protect users' rights and create an online culture of zero tolerance to VAW. They should develop corporate policies, practices and tools that respect women's rights, including effective complains mechanisms and technical safety measures to protect personal data. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; Media literacy and empowering women users: Preventing VAW requires changing attitudes and behaviour within society, including work with ICT user communities and potential victims of ICT-related violence. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; The mass media has an important role to play in responding to technology-related violence, especially preventing the secondary victimisation of victims/survivors. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; The role of ICT in supporting victim/survivors of violence: building capacity through support networks, such as MDG3: Take Back the Tech! (a project organised by APC WNSP against gender-based violence), helping local partners to participate in critical international and regional ICT policy-making spaces and engage with their national governments; as well as digital storytelling as a way of assisting victims/survivors in the healing process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>REDD+ aims to create incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions through the protection and better management of forests. However, despite of generating multiple co-benefits for nature and people, there have been concerns that the implementation of REDD+ may have negative impacts on biodiversity. Safeguards can help to reduce risks and maximise benefits for biodiversity conservation. This report analyses existing conditions and experiences with regard to biodiversity safeguards for REDD+ in Ecuador and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. It makes recommendations for the consideration of potential risks and opportunities for biodiversity conservation in the context of REDD+, especially for policies, activities, projects and programmes supported by development cooperation. It is intended as a technical input to inform decision-makers and practitioners on how to systematically enhance the synergies between REDD+ and the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network summarises guidelines for climate change adaption in the coastal city of Cartagena de Indias in Colombia. It outlines the process leading to creation of the guidelines and highlights how they lay the foundation for a full municipal adaptation plan. According to the brief, the government of Colombia is also closely following the progress of this municipal process, which will influence the implementation of the National Adaptation Plan and similar approaches in other coastal cities and towns in Colombia. Despite several recent changes in the political leadership of Cartagena, the city leaders seem to generally consider adaptation as an important opportunity to build resilience and improve the quality of life of its citizens. The brief concludes that planning for climate resilience is an ongoing process that requires constant and sustained capacity building of local stakeholders. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Access and quality of elementary education is one of the prime issues concerning the nation and an important factor contributing towards empowerment of marginalized communities. Videoshala is an endeavor to apply the model of Community Videos for improving quality of elementary education. Videoshala, as the name suggests is an intervention in ‘shalas1’ through videos. As more and more domains of our lives are facilitated, and in some cases governed, by technology and as technological innovations are happening at such a fast pace, it is important to ensure that the most marginalized communities get access to technology to better their own lives. For this it is imperative that technology is not just used for issues concerning the marginalized communities, but that it be used by the communities too. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The charcoal sector provides one of the greatest opportunities to prevent carbon emissions in least developed countries (LDCs) while fostering significant sustainable development benefits. The objective of this nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA) study is to provide Uganda with an opportunity to help shape its future low carbon development. The study focuses on the three middle components of the value chain – production, transportation and retail – and provides information about the Ugandan context, the stakeholders involved, the relevant policies and institutional framework, technology options for improved production, measuring, reporting and verification, and the assessment of support needs. It also presents the next steps in the NAMA process, in particular, the development of a NAMA design document and, eventually, implementation. Finally, the study identifies potential donors to fund these stages. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Human activities in ecosystems interfere with natural processes and cause habitat fragmentation and loss. This restricts wildlife movement consequently reducing the gene flow and genetic diversity. Increased human encroachment on wildlife habitat compromises immunity and disturbs host-pathogen relationships resulting in disease outbreaks in na&amp;iuml;ve populations. The Serengeti ecosystem is a useful area to study interactions between disease, human factors and wildlife because it has some of the largest wildlife populations in Africa and areas surrounding the ecosystem hold some of the highest livestock populations in Tanzania which can interact freely with wildlife in some areas.

    <dcterms:abstract>Electronic commerce, very important part of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICT), is one of the most common business terms in use in 21st century. Developed countries are more popular because of their rapid growth of ICT, e-commerce and online transaction. But in developing or under develop countries the scenario is different. Technical laggings, dearth of infrastructure, infeasibility of the existing frameworks and people apathy are the main reasons behind this. There are several alternative ways of e-commerce and online transaction. Mobile payment, a way of online transaction, may be beneficial way of payment for developing countries because of its mobile network infrastructure. In this paper, a model of electronic payment system for M-Commerce has been proposed and analyzed the security for the system. This proposal may be suitable for developing countries where mobile phones are available but other e-payment tools like debit and credit cards are not much a &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study explores the barriers to utilizing information and communication technologies for teaching and learning in Jordan as seen by the different involve d stakeholders: students, teachers, and administrators. The paper investigates these barriers through an interpretative case study which is the Jordanian Education Initiative (JEI) and uses the technology-to-performance chain model (TPC) as a conceptual research framework. Fifteen barriers were identified based on this qualitative research; twelve of them can be directly attributed to utilization factors proposed by the TPC model which were also viewed as barrier factors (expected consequences and affect toward use, habit, social norms, and facilitating condition); significant number of identified barriers can be related to “facilitating conditions” which puts more responsibility on the ministry of education to offer more resources and opportunities to facilitate the process of integrating technology into education in Jordan . &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This expert paper was written by Dr. Dubravka Simonovic, a member of the UN CEDAW Committee, for the expert group meeting on the &amp;lsquo;Prevention of violence against women and girls&amp;rsquo; (September 2012). The purpose of the meeting was to contribute to a deeper understanding of violence against women and girls, in preparation for 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the introduction, the author writes about the importance of the CEDAW Convention (1979) and its Optional Protocol (2000). Although there is not a specific global convention on the prevention of violence against women, CEDAW protects women from all forms of discrimination, including violence against women. However, gender-based violence, especially domestic violence, remains the most common and widespread violation of women&amp;rsquo;s human rights. The author then goes on to describe the significance of CEDAW in international human rights law, highlighting important features, such as its comprehensiveness and adaptability. Although CEDAW does not contain an explicit article on violence against women, the CEDAW Committee has recommended an interpretation of violence against women as falling under the convention. Before examining this recommendation in more depth, the author describes the main principles and key concepts of CEDAW.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The following sections discuss the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (DATE), looking particularly at its relationship to CEDAW; the UN Declaration on Violence against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1993; development at the regional level, with particular focus on the Istanbul Convention, adopted by the Council of Europe in 2011; and the jurisprudence of CEDAW, referring to specific cases on violence against women brought before the CEDAW Committee under the Optional Protocol. The final section describes the function of the CEDAW Committee&amp;rsquo;s concluding observations and related follow-up procedure (introduced in 2008), and provides a brief synopsis of the most important concerns raised by the Committee over the years regarding violence against women. This synopsis is divided into these topics: reservations, legislation and implementation, comprehensive approaches in preventing and combating violence against women, articles and stereotypes, provision of support measures for victims of domestic violence, and data and research. On this last topic, the author writes that, &amp;ldquo;the Committee has consistently called attention to the limited availability of data on various forms of violence against women and has called for data collection relevant for the prevalence of violence against women.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related resource: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;Report of the Expert Group Meeting on Prevention of Violence against Women and Girls&amp;rsquo;, UN Women in cooperation with ESCAP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and WHO, Bangkok, Thailand, 17-20 September 2012, EGM/PP/2012/Report &lt;br /&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Report-of-the-EGM-on-Prevention-of-Violence-against-Women-and-Girls.pdf &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study was conducted to determine the household and community level socio-economic and environmental factors associated with child nutritional status in Cameroon, and changes in the effects of these factors during the 1990s economic crisis. Age-specific effects of household economic status on child nutrition was also considered. Child nutritional status was measured by weight-for-age (WAZ) and height-for-age (HAZ) z scores. Data was obtained from demographic and health surveys conducted in 1991 and 1998. Average WAZ and HAZ declined respectively from -0.70 standard deviation below the median to -0.83 and from -1.03 SD to -1.14 SD between 1991 and 1998. These declines occurred mostly among boys, children over 12 months of age and those of low socioeconomic status. Both household and community factors have significant impact on child health in Cameroon. Understanding these relationships can facilitate design of age and community- specific intervention programs &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The features of Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s development record are of particular importance .This paper examines Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s socioeconomic development since the early 1990s peace settlement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper notes that the country&amp;rsquo;s economic growth has seemingly been the fastest among post-conflict societies, and the growth has been driven by a number of factors. These include the credible restoration of security, large public and private capital inflows, economic openness, prudent macroeconomic management, and an integrating neighborhood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings contain:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cambodia has achieved much more rapid economic development over the past 2 decades than even the most optimistic forecasts could have projected&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the Cambodian people are now better educated and fed, and they have greater social and occupational choice than ever before &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;at this rate of progress, the country will very shortly graduate from the &amp;lsquo;least developed&amp;rsquo; group of countries, and within a decade or so, it would enter the middle-income developing group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;However, the paper highlights some key challenges, including rising inequality, uneven spatial development, weak institutions, and high levels of corruption. In addition, Key supply side challenges remain, particularly education at all levels and rural infrastructure. Furthermore, Cambodia has limited space in its trade and commercial policies, and it does not have monetary policy independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward, the author emphasises the importance of strengthening supply side capabilities, broadening the benefits of growth, and developing stronger institutions and property rights. Additionally, the document underscores that the priority of growth at all costs will need to give way to greater attention to distributional considerations, between households, regions, and particularly the capital and the rest of the country. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Hypertension in the Children is increasingly being recognized as an emerging critical healthcare problem, because of its increasing prevalence in recent years and also of its significant impact on the health and well-being of children and adolescents and tracking into adult life.1 Pediatric hypertension has unique features that differentiate it from hypertension in adults. It is widely accepted that childhood hypertension provides an increased risk for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is a known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) in adults, and the presence of childhood hypertension may contribute to the early development of CAD. Reports show that early development of atherosclerosis does exist in children and young adults and may be associated with childhood hypertension. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper describes the scope and use of different ICT tools in the Norwegian central government by focusing on both e-government and features of e-democracy; and the perceived effects of ICT on economy, service quality, transparency, coordination, political and administrative control and user participation. It also aims at explaining the influence of ICT tools on variations in such perceived effects relative to other factors influencing decision making behaviour in the central civil service, such as structural features, demography and administrative culture. The major findings are, first, that government-to-government tools are the most widespread and that e-democracy tools have received little attention. Second, the effects are strongest regarding better public services, increased transparency and internal coordination and administrative control and weakest when it comes to coordination with local government and political control. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Various initiatives in the recent past portrayed the significant role that the I.C.T plays in the realm of rural development. Several projects have reduced the costs, and it also has increased transparency. A large number of rural e-Governance applications, developed as pilot projects were aimed at offering easy access to citizen services and improved processing of government to citizen transactions. This paper presents a brief review of the innovative projects in Information and communication technologies for rural development and how far it has contributed. The other aim is to ponder over the achievements and the failures of ICT in the sustainable development march. The analysis also indicates communication related initiatives and projects for development before media liberalization and post media liberalization. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The last five Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data8-12 from 1993 to 2007 show that there has not been significant change in exclusive breastfeeding rates nationally and this is reflected in almost static nutritional status and neonatal mortality rates. This is not, however, true of the 109 National Nutrition Programme (NNP) upazilas where, by an intervention of nutrition promotion through the Community Nutrition Promoters (affectionately called Pushti Apas), the neonatal mortality fell to 13 per 1,000 live births13 in 2007-08 compared to a national figure of 37 in 2007.12 At the same time infant mortality fell to 22 compared to a national figure of 57. There are now two main reasons for poor breastfeeding rates in this country: a lack of support for mothers to initiate and sustain breastfeeding and secondly the erosion in breastfeeding practices by the violations of the national and international codes for the marketing of breastmilk substitutes by the milk companies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Water security is becoming increasingly problematic in semi-arid regions as a result of climate change. In response, Brazil’s federal government implemented two large programmes to build water infrastructure and facilitate access. However, the initiatives had a limited focus on water management, a gap that was filled by civil society to help put water to its most productive use. This brief describes these complementary initiatives, focusing on offering useful lessons learned for readers in other regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>It is now widely accepted that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an important role in national development. However, the nature of the link between the two remains unclear. Much of this state is due to lack of clarity on how ICT is conceptualized in this context. While some conceptual frameworks have been proposed, they lack important aspects that can give a more comprehensive picture. In this paper, we attempt to further clarify how ICT is conceptualised in development. Using secondary data, we evaluate two conceptual frameworks that bring together the range of views of ICT, their manifold impacts, and the assumptions and perspectives of the range of actors in any given development project that involves ICT. The specific case we examine is an e-Government initiative called e-Seva in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. We found that even when using the two frameworks in conjunction, many aspects of the ICT initiatives remain unclear. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This discussion note on global competitiveness and equitable growth driven by innovation, aims to highlight key trends and developments in the ICT industry, especially in India, the challenges faced, and ways to address them. The Indian ICT Industry has witnessed excellent growth in the past two decades. Capitalizing on its advantages of talent pool, lower cost of operation and the innovative remote delivery model, India has established itself as a global leader in the ICT sector. Today, India is clearly acknowledged as the global services hub. However, the industry today is facing many challenges in terms of rising costs, availability of quality talent pool, security and IP protection and infrastructure concerns. This coupled with changing customer expectations and emergence of other low cost locations is further deepening the threat to the Indian ICT industry. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh is trade-liberalized country but still it has one of the top ranked trade protection policy in the world. The study focuses on the issue of whether further trade liberalization policy reform accelerate economic development of Bangladesh and where do the impacts of trade liberalization debate still exist in case of Bangladesh economy. To evaluate the objectives this study simulates trade policy reform by 50% tariff reduction through computable general equilibrium modeling. The results revealed that overall economy wide impact of trade liberalization is mixed. Due to tariff cut, import increases in all sectors but export shows mixed effect and raises the debate. Mixed effect or sector's production shows existence of debate on the issue of sectors competitiveness with foreign commodity. Increase production of competitive sectors show potential impact of tariff cut. Efficient resource allocation by competitive sector raises factor demand, which increases total factor income.

    <dcterms:abstract>Patriarchy is the prime obstacle to womenâ€™s advancement and development. Despite differences in levels of domination the broad principles remain the same, i.e. men are in control. The nature of this control may differ. So it is necessary to understand the system, which keeps women dominated and subordinate, and to unravel its workings in order to work for womenâ€™s development in a systematic way. In the modern world where women go ahead by their merit, patriarchy there creates obstacles for women to go forward in society. Because patriarchal institutions and social relations are responsible for the inferior or secondary status of women. Patriarchal society gives absolute priority to men and to some extent limits womenâ€™s human rights also. Patriarchy refers to the male domination both in public and private spheres. In this way, feminists use the term â€˜patriarchyâ€™ to describe the power relationship between men and women as well as to find out the root cause of womenâ€™s subordination. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This 2012 annual report of the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), jointly produced by its partner multilateral development banks, provides an overview of CIF's activities in 49 pilot countries. So far CIF has pledged US $7.6 billion, funding 66 projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean transport, sustainable management of forests and climate resilience. The report includes chapters on: climate resilient development; ensuring Africa's water, food, and energy security; keeping Latin American and Caribbean watersheds in balance; spotlight on climate resilient agriculture; climate proofing infrastructure in Asia; and unlocking the potential of the private sector in adapting to climate change. The 2012 report highlights that CIF's learning-by-doing approach encourages feedback from pilot countries. However, it also notes that better monitoring practices of pilot CIF projects require the enhancement of institutional and organisational frameworks in user countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In this study author elaborated how e-government studies can benefit from three bodies of knowledge which have their off spring in social sciences, if e-government studies want to increase their explanatory power. In doing so, author has also presented number of research questions that will enable scholars of e-government to strengthen the explanatory quality of their research. In section three author elaborated on how e-government studies might benefit from innovation studies, because e-government refers to the promise of renewal, of letting the past behind. Furthermore, many e-government studies do not substantially question the role of technology-in-use. This is peculiar, because ICT is embraced as the major source of innovation and driver for change. Hence, it would be interesting to see in section four, how e-government studies might benefit from technology studies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

This is followed by identification of prerequisites for a sustainable ICT in Education execution in Malaysia given the unique characteristics of our education system and bold aspiration of our nation. The broader scheme of ‘ICT in Education’ covered in the policy encompasses all the current ICT initiatives that have been rolled out i.e. SchoolNet, Computer Lab, EduWebTV, Teaching of Mathematics and Science in English (PPSMI) and Access Centre and all future ICT initiatives under a common set of objectives instead of allowing each ICT initiative being implemented independently. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is sparking renewed interest and debate on issues such as transparency of government &amp;ndash; company contracts, reporting on revenues from natural resources by company and by project, and reporting on revenue expenditure. An overarching concern is how to ensure that revenue transparency ultimately leads to better sustainable-development outcomes, including socio-economic development, poverty reduction and environmentally responsible extractive-industry practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discussion paper highlights key issues and new challenges related to EITI implementation, as well as broader issues of transparency and good governance in the extractive industries.&amp;nbsp; The paper is based on a series of dialogues relating to transparency and good governance in the Caspian Sea Region:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Azerbaijan &amp;ndash; the first country globally to become EITI Compliant&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Kazakhstan &amp;ndash; an EITI Candidate country seeking to become Compliant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;and Turkmenistan &amp;ndash; which is not a signatory of EITI but has expressed some interest in learning about the initiative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations from the Caspian dialogues include the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;provide further strategic, administrative and technical support for disaggregated reporting of payments to governments (e.g. company-by- company and project-by-project)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;identify current and potential ways in which the EITI process can contribute to accountability and sustainability in host countries and support relevant research on these linkages&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;develop guidance on good practice in sub-national reporting, and support pilot initiatives, such as reporting on public monitoring of community development spending&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;prioritise capacity building as an essential part of the EITI agenda, especially for local government and CSOs at the sub-national level&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ensure clarity in new rules and procedures, to strengthen minimum requirements and avoid any ambiguity that allows too much flexibility in implementation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;develop self-evaluation criteria and processes for EITI, such as progress ranking among member countries, based on competitive and motivational indicators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The introduction of ICT in the last two decades or so in India has brought about enormous changes in every sphere of life
and especially in the field of education. This new digital technology has become inevitable and essential and it promises revolutionary benefits for the present and future. But along the way it also poses certain challenges which need to be addressed holistically in effective ways in order to keep pace with the rest of the world and ensure a robust system. This paper takes an overview of the present state of ICT in India and discusses the core issues relating to planning and implementation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This project, carried out for the Committee of the Regions, aims to present and evaluate relevant examples of best practices in the implementation of the « eEurope » action plan by local and regional authorities which contribute through their eGovernment programmes. eGovernment is defined by the EU Commission as the use of information and communication technologies in public administrations combined with organisational change and new skills in order to improve public services and democratic processes and strengthen support to public policies. Based on the results of the best practice analysis, the project will illustrate the role the regions and cities of the European Union must play in this field, and will bring proposals to encourage the deployment of eGovernment and, at a larger scale, the development of telecommunication infrastructures and their use by everyone. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Business services are key for growth. This paper argues that developing Asia is overlooking an opportunity for increased growth and development through trade in business services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper argues that developing Asia would benefit from liberalising services trade as it has benefited from liberalising goods trade - the same potential exists in business services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Asian business service sectors are relatively small and expensive&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in fact, many business services are tradable, but developing Asia has relatively high barriers to services trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;developing Asia should reduce policy impediments to business services trade&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the long run fix to small and expensive business service sector is to increase the skill abundance of Asia&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this context, increasing educational attainment in developing Asia is likely to resolve this issue over the long term, so the region should continue to make education a priority&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;similarly, all Asian countries should collect and publish more detailed information on the service sector and its trade - to understand what is happening in the service sector requires a much richer view than is currently possible &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;however, in the short run, it makes sense to import business services from the developing world and take advantage of the gains to trade in this large and vital sector &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In Latin America, as in Africa and Asia, 15-25% of the population lives in semi-arid areas, mostly in small isolated rural communities that are often the most severely affected by climate change. Strategies employed to build adaptive capacity in Brazil’s semi-arid areas focused on improved water supply, management and use, while at the same time promoting access to technology and improved production techniques, all with a focus on knowledge sharing and multi-level collaboration. The lessons from Brazil’s response will be useful for policymakers and community organisations in other semi-arid regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. This is the first Sub-Report on the District of Majune. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Tanzania has been investing in the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT) in education for several decades. However, little is known about teachers’ perceptions about ICT integration in education. This study examined teachers’ perceptions about the use of ICT tools for teaching, administration, professional development and personal use. Seventy four teachers were involved in the study. Data were collected through an online survey using SurveyMonkey and postings generated from the researcher’s blog. Qualitative data were downloaded from the blog and from SurveyMonkey; read word for word; and analysed using Weft QDA where themes related to the research questions were coded while quantitative data from SurveyMonkey were analysed online in the form of percentages. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study aimed to explore the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households with and without child domestic workers (CDW), and explore the causes and process of becoming CDWs in Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data. A purposive sampling technique was applied to select the sample locations. Data were collected from six districts of Bangladesh:Mymensingh, Kishoreganj, Jamalpur, Bhola, Kurigram, Chapai Nawabganj, and a slum of Dhaka city. A total of 1,564 (rural 1,454 and urban 110) parents of with and
without CDWs were interviewed. Ten in-depth interviews with CDWs were conducted. The findings reveals that small income, poor savings, marginal land, less access to NGO services, and sickness of main income earner in the family were the causes that compelled parents to allow their children in CDW. The findings also
strongly observed that poverty is the root cause to engage children in domestic work. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia is mostly established retrospectively. But it is difficult to diagnose perinatal asphyxia retrospectively in the absence of perinatal records. As because of hypoxaemia, different organ systems of the body are affected in perinatal asphyxia, this study was done to assess the hepatic function for the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia and to find out any correlation existing between hepatic enzyme change and the severity of perinatal asphyxia. It is concluded that estimation of hepatic enzymes can be used to diagnose perinatal asphyxia and also to assess its severity. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper investigates the determinants of household food security
situation in Bangladesh. Different household characteristics seem to be strongly correlated with food security indicator which might be helpful in identifying the food insecure households. Regression results show that food security indicator is also highly sensitive to rice price changes. Comparison of different occupational groups was also studied with the findings that wage earners, both daily wage and salary wage earners, are worse off in terms of food security status compared to self-employed-both in agriculture and non-agricultural sector. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh is faced with trying to ensure it maximises the economic benefits it receives from trade liberalization actions by the Government of Canada. Canada progressively reduced barriers to the exports of developing countries and Least Developed Countries1 beginning in 2002 culminating with the Market Access Initiative (MAI) for Least Developed Countries, effective January 1, 2003. Bangladesh reaped considerable benefits from this initiative, capturing export gains, particularly in textiles and apparel where it was export ready and competitive. The MAI afforded preferential access to the Canadian market for Bangladesh in products where it is highly competitive and Bangladesh’s exports to Canada grew rapidly. 
Canada continued to liberalize its market in 2004 by reducing MFN tariff rates. Further liberalization will take place in 2005. As part of its WTO commitments, Canada also removed all quotas on textile and apparel imports on January 1, 2005. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

The general objective was to collect and compile information about communities covered by the Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme for the development of a comprehensive community mobilization strategy. Main stakeholders in the community were identified in addition to community organization and groups, formal and informal channels of communication, health attitude and health-seeking behaviours. Other features identified include social organization and social solidarity mechanisms. Key features of the community that could directly or indirectly affect the planning and implementation were also considered. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The African elephant is facing the greatest crisis in decades. Reports of mass elephant killings in the media illustrate the situation across many African elephant range States. Surges in poaching, the illegal ivory trade and accelerating habitat and range loss have put African elephant populations at risk. This Rapid Response Assessment provides an overview of the status of elephants, poaching and illegal ivory trafficking along the entire ivory trade supply chain. Findings presented here were obtained from a range of sources, including The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) Programme, the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), the IUCN/SSC African Ele phant Specialist Group (AfESG), the African and Asian Ele phant Database, the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC), expert consultations and a range of other sources. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Women and men, owning to their gendered responsibilities, possess unique knowledge sets about forest resources. This knowledge can be applied to achieving successful sustainable forest management. Accrediting this unique knowledge provides both legitimate recognition of their engagement in decision-making processes and equitable share of benefits. This holds enormous significance in climate change mitigation programs (such as REDD+- Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) since these programs provides benefits to stakeholders based on their recognition of regulated performance to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions Yet, the paucity of relevant tools that facilitate translating gender principles into climate change mitigation projects/REDD+ practice is evident. Development practitioners implementing those projects require better understanding about the tools that facilitate achieving development benefits to both women and men, while also reducing emissions. This document primarily serves as a practical implementation tool to mainstream gender mainstreaming into climate change mitigation/REDD+ programs. This strategy and checklist developed in the document come from the direct and practical experience of gender mainstreaming into USAID/ASIA's supported climate change mitigation project, named "Lowering Emissions in Asia Forests" that runs in 6 countries (Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea) of Asia-Pacific. However, this document can be useful to implement and monitor gender issues in climate change mitigation project in other regions as well. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is considered a low-prevalence country with 2,533 cumulative reported cases since 1989 and approximately 7,500 people living with HIV.&amp;nbsp; Routine surveillance has consistently reported HIV prevalence of less than 1.0 percent among the general population and among MSM and male and female sex workers. The country&amp;rsquo;s epidemic is understood to be concentrated and disproportionately affects male people who use drugs, of whom 1.0 percent are believed to be living with HIV. Between 2008 and 2011, 19 cases of HIV among MSM were reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given HIV patterns in South Asia and because of recent behavioural survey data of MSM in Dhaka, Bangladesh considers MSM one of the focal points in their HIV prevention efforts. In 2009 and again in 2010, the National STD/AIDS Programme and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR) conducted a size estimation exercise of key affected populations that included MSM. Such efforts are beginning to shed light on what is otherwise a poorly understood demographic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the nature of male-male sexuality in Bangladesh. Previous exploratory research has consistently found that approximately 2 percent of males engage in same-sex sexual behaviour. Research has found a  high prevalence of penetrative sex as well as related risk behaviours among MSM. Despite popular disapproval of sexual relationships between men, intimate relationships between men are common and sexual boundaries are crossed with relative ease. The socio-cultural contexts  in which such interactions occur determine how MSM perceive and manage sexual risk and thus impact the uptake of HIV services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Bangladesh reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>About one third of the adults in the world including increasing number of women (250 million) daily smoke (22% in developed world &amp; 9% of women in developing world). Approximately 28% women in Bangladesh use smokeless tobacco (ST). The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome including spontaneous abortion,stillbirth,preterm delivery and giving birth to low birth weight baby (lbw) are quite high in Bangladesh. Tobacco is a preventable cause of maternal and neonatal mortality.This review article intended to find out any association between prolonged maternal smokeless tobacco use and pregnancy outcome. We reviewed various national &amp; international research papers, thesis papers and articles about smokeless tobacco use and pregnancy outcome. It can be concluded that prolonged use of smokeless tobacco have significant association and risk with spontaneous abortion,stillbirth,preterm delivery and LBW baby. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Oxfam briefing reveals that decades of appallingly low investment in the public health sector has left India with a health system, which is unable to meet the needs of its citizens. Despite recent efforts to strengthen the public health system, India has one of the lowest levels of government investment in health in the world. The gap left by the public health system, combined with a government policy of proactively promoting the private sector, has led to the proliferation of unregulated private health providers. Oxfam urges India to prioritise strengthening and scaling-up of a universal public health care system, designed to improve accountability and promote community participation in planning and monitoring health services. The brief recommends that the regulation of private providers must be properly enforced, and further promotion and funding of public-private partnerships must cease until quality and equity performance standards have improved. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Scarce water and high temperatures have shaped the cultures of the Arab region over thousands of years. Today, however, the region is confronting climate variability and change that could alter and threaten development in the region. This report presents detailed case studies on the impacts of climate change in the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and the Republic of Yemen. The Arab region is already being impacted by climate change through more frequent cyclones, floods and prolonged droughts. Thousands of rural producers have seen their crops and herds devastated by extreme conditions, and have been forced to abandon their traditional way of life and migrate to urban areas. Those who stay behind in rural areas struggle to cope with shortages of food and water. This report assesses how severely climate change will affect the three countries and stresses the necessity of considering the impacts of climate change in future development strategies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This technical bulletin gives an overview to what treatment as prevention (TasP). Treatment as prevention (TasP) is a HIV prevention intervention where treating an HIV-positive person with antiretroviral medication is used to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to a negative partner. The primary purpose of antiretroviral treatment (ART) is to treat HIV disease in order to improve health and extend lifespan. TasP is a secondary benefit of ART. The bulletin highlights the challenges and risks to MSM using the TasP method and details the current research for the TasP method globally. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Jordan is dominated by arid climate with limited arable land and water resources. This study focuses on crop production and water resources under trends of anticipated climate change and population growth to analyse how these affect water and food security in the country. It finds that recession of irrigated areas led to lesser food production and food security. Results indicate that climate change and population growth increase and intensify problems of water scarcity and food insecurity. The study underlines the need for adaptive measures to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on water resources and food security. It suggests that at decision-maker level the development of water resources to increase supply is a top priority. At the user level, adaptation measures should focus on managing the demand by increasing water use efficiency and the adoption of appropriate cropping patterns that consume less water and produce more food. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As climate change impacts are increasingly felt by smallholder farmers, there is an urgent need to identify approaches that strengthen ongoing economic development efforts and enhance the adaptive capacity of farmers, their households and their communities. Through a literature review and analysis of case studies of two Fairtrade-certified farmer organisations in Uganda and Malawi, this paper explores the links between farmer organisations, Fairtrade and adaptation to climate change, as well as the extent to which such institutions and market arrangements can enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. The paper’s findings suggest that membership of farmer organisations and participation in Fairtrade can strengthen smallholders’ capacity to adapt to climate change in a number of ways, including: better access to services; strengthened social capital within local communities; enhanced financial capital and improved access to credit; and access to market information. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper discusses the methodology of Young Lives - a 15-year study of childhood poverty in Ethiopia, India, Vietnam and Peru, following the lives of 3,000 children in each country.&amp;nbsp; The Young Lives programme is interested in children&amp;rsquo;s development within the context of economic constraint and disparities, and cumulative risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s well-being and life chances are, however, interdependent with those of their parents and carers and the communities in which they reside, so Young Lives also considers household and community circumstances as central to child well-being. Additionally, the impacts of poverty have to be assessed in terms of other forms of risk to children, such as environmental hazards or ill-health that are often a cause of, or exacerbated by, material lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young Lives conceptualises poverty as multidimensional in both its causes and its consequences. Access to resources (financial and other) is at the root of poverty, and there are a number of channels through which poverty may operate and create risks for children. The advantages of multidimensional approaches are that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;they help to demonstrate the interconnected nature of different aspects of deprivation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;they analyse when income is (or is not) a good predictor of outcomes important for children; and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;they can be used to summarise an aggregate of change over time in a more holistic and complete way than income measures alone &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper outlines some critiques of international trade and investment law which argued that such law is tilted in favour of developed states. Addressing the question: ‘Will the rise of the BRICS lead to changes in international economic law?’, the author points out that the BRICS states have relied to varying degrees on industrial policy to achieve more rapid growth and have resisted some of the pressures of international economic law. Their markets are also increasingly important to the world economy and they are increasing their influence in international organizations. It is also argued that Brazil, India and China have developed major capacity in the field of international economic law, and have been able to legally protect domestic policy space from external restrictions. However, efforts by the BRICS have not fully succeeded in this area. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>These global guidelines, produced by WHO, UNAIDS and UNFPA, aim to provide technical recommendations on effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV and other STIs among sex workers and their clients. The guidelines are designed for use by national public health officials and managers of HIV and STI programmes, civil society and health workers. Regions and countries are encouraged to adapt these guidelines to support acceptable services for sex workers taking into account the epidemiological and social context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This assessment on Leveraging ICT Effectively to Strengthen HIV Prevention for Newborns and Monitoring of Maternal and Child Health in Asia-Pacific examines the current and potential use of ICT in strengthening the monitoring of PMTCT, primarily by addressing loss of follow-up in advancing the course towards eliminating paediatric HIV by 2015 or beyond in 11 countries. These countries are: Cambodia, Fiji, India, Kiribati, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. It is envisaged that the findings and the way forward outlined in this assessment will bring greater clarity in leveraging ICT effectively to strengthen PMTCT, Maternal and Child Health and the health information system. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>There is little evidence on the effectiveness of child protection programmes in developing countries. Furthermore, some of the available evidence does not provide information on links between specific practices on the one hand and improved outcomes and impact for children on the other hand. There are, however, some targeted insights into what works and what does not work.&lt;P&gt;Overall, the effectiveness of child protection programmes seems to be only average and highly variable. One commonly cited finding is the importance of contextualising action: programming, programme implementation and programme assessment need to be tailored to local situations and practices in child protection. It is also important to acknowledge that child protection is political and reflects political choices by governments and donors.&lt;P&gt;This report first identifies and describes the state of available evidence. It then presents findings on the effectiveness of child protection programmes in developing countries in five selected areas:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;general factors affecting the effectiveness of child protection programmes;&lt;LI&gt;different types of child protection measures;&lt;LI&gt;specific settings and contexts;&lt;LI&gt;specific categories of children;&lt;LI&gt;cost effectiveness.&lt;/UL&gt;  &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAC Working Paper 54&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Kojo Sebastian Amanor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper examines how liberal economic reforms that permeated and transformed economies during the 1980s and 1990s, both in the emerging BRICS powers themselves as well as in Africa, mediate and influence the relationships between emergent powers and African nations. It investigates the impact of South-South relations on the nature of development and technical cooperation, aid and investment, as well as in the configuration of relations between states, farmers and the private sector. It then examines the extent to which the experiences of China and Brazil in developing their agriculture result in qualitatively new paradigms for agricultural development which create opportunities for a redefinition of the development of policy and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it looks at how South-South development cooperation may merely reinforce the drive to capital accumulation unleashed by global economic liberalisation, and reflect strategies by emergent powers to acquire new markets for agricultural technology, inputs, services and new sources of raw materials. Finally, the paper questions the extent to which alternative paradigms can be created within the institutional framework created by neoliberal reform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study provides a broad sweep of the ICT arena, introducing gender issues. It offers a birdâ€™s eye view of the central themes in the gender and ICTs debate. It covers four broad areas: some basic information on gender and technology; the meaning of ICTs; the ICT arena â€“ its key players and key politics; and an analysis of how gender has featured in the information society debate. This report goes on to discuss inequities in the ICT arena, and the gender dimensions of these inequities. The potential for ICTs to promote womenâ€™s rights and empowerment are also discussed and it concludes with a discussion of the directions for engendering the ICT arena. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The poor in Bangladesh are more likely to belong to households with a larger number of dependents, lower education, engaged in daily wage labor, own little land and less likely to receive remittances. This poverty profile for 2005 is similar to those in the mid-1980s apparently indicating that little has changed over time. A closer look at the survey data, however, suggests a much more nuanced story. The paper uses two rounds of the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) to decompose the micro-determinants of poverty reduction between 2000 and 2005 closely following similar analysis using earlier rounds of the HIES from the 1980s and 1990s. The comparison of results shows that the spatial distribution of poverty has changed over the three decades, the drivers of poverty reduction are different in several respects, and that policies to spur further reduction in poverty need to be adjusted in the light of these shifts over time. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Environmental Management Measure (EMM) model will be a well-designed approach for sustainable and effective solid waste management in Dhaka city. Environmental Management Measure (EMM) model has three instruments such as economic, regulatory and suasive which proposed in this paper. This paper discusses the situation of solid waste in Dhaka city as well as it offers environmental policy recommendations to concerned authorities including effective instruments to minimize the polluting behavior of individuals and industries and to recover the cost of pollution in the city. To improve solid waste management in Dhaka city, a combination of economic, regulatory and suasive instrument are recommended.

    <dcterms:abstract>Poverty monitoring and evaluation in Mozambique primarily take place within the framework of the implementation of Mozambique‟s Poverty Reduction Strategy PARP/A, and is informed by quantitative data derived from different types of national surveys and similar studies done by bilateral and multilateral aid organisations. However, by their quantitative nature such surveys do not capture all the dimensions of poverty that are relevant to the design of policies and programmes. While quantitative data yield valuable information about the mapping and profile of poverty over space and time, qualitative data are necessary in order to better understand the dynamics of poverty and the coping strategies of the poor. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper examined the use of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in teaching Islamic subjects in religious schools. Besides that, this paper also studies the IT usage in teaching Islamic Religious Knowledge (IRK) subjects in secular schools (non-religious or normal schools). Religious schools also known as Islamic School are managed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs while secular schools are managed by the Ministry of Education and other private organizations. However, the curriculum of Islamic and IRK subjects are controlled by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. In 2008, the Ministry of Education introduced a new education system known as SPN21 or Sistem Pendidikan Negara Abad 21 (21st Century Brunei
Education System). In the system, IRK become one of the „core‟ subjects, means that every student must take IRK at all level. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An experiment was conducted at the Agroforestry Model Farm, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Dinajpur to study 11 vital yield traits, yield and quality of a local variety of ginger cultured under three Agroforestry systems, i.e. beneath the shades of Three multi-use tree species (2.5 years old) and also in the open field. So, the four treatments were: Open field having no shade vis-a-vis full sunlight (Ti control), under guava Trees with 70±5% shade (T2) below black sins trees providing 60±5% shade (I3) and underneath mango trees having 50±5% shade (14). The trial was set in the Randomized Complete Block Design. Eleven vegetative traits (plant height, number of leaves per plant, number of tillers per plant, leaf size, number of finger per plant, finger fresh weight per plant, finger dry weight per plant, rhizome fresh weight per plant, rhizome dry weight per plant rhizome yield per plot and rhizome yield per hectare) were investigated. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study recommended adjustments to the scope of the Fund and a tendering process for private operators, which have led to a series of projects that have significantly increased Internet access in rural Chile. It is expected that by February 2012, coverage of broadband Internet services will reach more than 90 percent or the rural population of Chile. Pakistan's modelâ€”the administration of the Universal Access Fund by a non-profit with an executive management teamâ€”is promising. Using a transparent mechanism for the award of subsidies from the Fund, it has already committed over 60 percent of all funds collected since it began operations, four years ago, increasing voice access to remote villages and extending fiber backbones across provinces. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;IATP have consistently argued that trade agreements need to respect and promote human rights, not drive a process of globalisation that privileges commercial interests and pushes public interests aside. This paper concludes that the globalisation enshrined in the free trade and investment agreements of the 1990s and 2000s have led to yet another manifestation of commercial interests trampling human rights - namely land grabs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper is specifically focuses on two forces that IATP argue have contributed significantly to the problem: First, globalisation&amp;mdash;more specifically, the deregulation of trade and foreign investment laws, which has greatly eased cross-border capital flows, relaxed the limits on foreign land ownership, and opened markets to agricultural imports. And second, the failures of the international trading system during the food price crisis of 2007-08, which eroded the confidence of food import&amp;ndash;dependent countries in international markets as a reliable source of food and fed both speculative investment and investment in actual food production. This loss of confidence&amp;nbsp;was compounded by climate change and the resulting destabilisation of weather patterns, which has resulted in less predictable agricultural production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst investment in agriculture is welcomed the impact of land grabs has been overwhelmingly negative. They are associated with weak institutional capacity (and sometimes corruption) in the recipient country governments, as well as authoritarian governments in the investors&amp;rsquo; home countries, making it hard to bring pressure there for better practices. The communities whose land is leased or bought are not adequately protected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four linked policy shifts to create a more stable and transparent international food system are needed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;reformed trade rules that ensure export measures are subject to transparency and predictability requirements and that allow all countries policy space for food security policies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;publicly-managed grain reserves to dampen the effects of supply shocks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;readily accessible funding for the poorest food importers, which would be triggered automatically when prices increase sharply in international markets&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the development of strong national and international laws to govern investment in land, respecting the principles and guidelines set out in the Voluntary Guidelines on Land Tenure. &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Mongolia. Mongolia hosts one of the region&amp;rsquo;s smallest HIV epidemics. It remained hidden until around 2007 when serological surveillance was performed after indications of rising incidence. From then until 2012, 75 HIV diagnoses were added to the HIV registry, bringing the total cumulative number of infections between 1992 and the end of 2011 to 100. Among these cases, 66 percent were reported cases among MSM. Given that between 1992 and 2007, data on sexual orientation were not collected, the 66 percent is probably an underestimation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to in neighbouring countries, MSM in Mongolia remain largely hidden because of widespread and institutionalised prejudice. Societal and family pressures lead many Mongolian MSM to marry and live secret &amp;lsquo;double lives&amp;rsquo; with both male and female sexual partners. One survey meant to gauge levels of discrimination against MSM in Ulaanbaatar and Darkhan-Uul found that 53 percent of respondents thought of MSM as healthy people whose sexual behaviour is abnormal, meanwhile 14 percent thought MSM are mentally ill. Arbitrary detentions and physical abuse by law enforcement authorities have also been recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2012 study discovered that stigma and discrimination against LGBT populations and MSM is common in Mongolia and creates significant barriers to health service access, employment, and social acceptance. The same study reported that 77.4 percent of MSM in Ulaanbaatar had experienced at least one of the following incidents in the last three years: forced sex or rape (14.7 percent); verbal harassment (54.8 percent); and physical harassment or beating (10.4 percent). Other key issues included: loss of employment upon discovery of sexual orientation or HIV status; being tested for HIV without consent; and blackmail by law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Mongolia reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report is the product of a sub-regional workshop on Gender and Urban Poverty in South Asia. The report highlights key gender issues in urban development and lessons learned from good practices that are achieving both gender equality results and sustainable urban development outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demonstrating the links between gender and socially inclusive urban development programs, the paper states that women are particularly vulnerable to the risks associated with urban poverty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings encompass:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;most urban development policies do not explicitly address gender and social issues in South Asia developing member countries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;South Asian women have weak participation and low representation in decision-making structures and processes related to urban services and governance &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, women&amp;rsquo;s needs and priorities are rarely considered in urban planning and investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Identically, the document suggests the following common approaches to gender and socially inclusive urban planning and governance:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in-depth surveys and separate consultations to understand the different needs and priorities of men and women&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;awareness-raising campaigns to promote women&amp;rsquo;s participation in preparing community action plans&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;mandatory quotas for women&amp;rsquo;s representation in local decision-making structures&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;partnerships between municipal bodies, the private sector, and local NGOs and CBOs to empower women to become change agents in their communities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;integrate gender-inclusive measures in the operational work and institutional strategies of the government agencies and their counterparts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the author suggests that gender-inclusive delivery of urban infrastructure and services should be strengthened. In particular, the paper emphasises that gendered investments in this field can have significant impacts on gender equality and women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment. The document illustrates that this can reduce women&amp;rsquo;s time poverty and improve their capabilities through access to resources, economic opportunities, and decision-making power. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper assesses the impact of trade liberalisation on wage inequality in the Bangladesh manufacturing sector over the period 1973-1994 by applying alternative techniques of two-stage least squares and error correction modeling. The study also examines the hypothesis that skilled labour and physical capital are complementary with each other. The study finds that wage inequality in the Bangladesh manufacturing sector, as measured by the ratio of the non-production workers’ wage to the production workers’ wage as well as by the Theil’s wage inequality index, has widened over time. The econometric results suggest that export orientation of the Bangladesh manufacturing sector has contributed to the widening of wage inequality, while the relative demand for skilled workers had an offsetting effect. Furthermore, the findings do not support the claim that skilled labour and capital are complementary with each other. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Throughout Latin America, civil society organisations (CSOs) are exacting accountability by undertaking independent assessments of the implementation and outcomes of public policies and programmes. To get the information needed for these assessments, CSOs have used the Right to Information guaranteed by Freedom of Information Acts (FOIAs), Constitutions or Court decisions. Using case studies from Mexico, Ecuador and Costa Rica, this brief analyses how CSOs are successfully using the right to information as a tool to improve accountability and social justice in Latin America. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As a young nation, Timor-Leste has made considerable advances in rebuilding its health system, but overall utilisation of health services remains low by regional standards. This paper underlines that the Timor-Leste population continues to face a heavy burden regarding maternal and child health, though the government is committed to improving the access of its people to adequate healthcare services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper highlights that public sector facilities in Timor-Leste are free to most patients, and informal payments are rare, unlike in other countries. However, it notes that: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;large disparities exist in use of critical maternal and child health services between rich and poor, and across districts, and these correlate with maternal and child health outcomes &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the limited financial impact of out-of-pocket spending is evident, but it does not mean that the there is good healthcare coverage&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;indeed, the low level of spending is largely because most families lack access to any medical facilities &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, a frequent shortage of medicines is an area where families do experience some financial burdens in obtaining care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expanding the use of facility-based maternal and child health services is critical to improving maternal and child health outcomes in Timor-Leste &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;expanding access to inpatient services is also critical to improve rates of skilled birth attendance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a matter of fact, the government must focus on expanding the service delivery network in rural areas to bring healthcare facilities closer to most families &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the Timorese healthcare system must be strengthened by improving the supply and availability of medicines in government facilities &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades, Latin American countries have designed and adopted Freedom of Information Acts (FOIAs). These FOIAs have increased transparency of government actions, ensured citizens’ right to request and access public information, and enhanced overall accountability. This Brief describes and analyses critical features of these Latin American legal frameworks, highlighting their originality, design, preliminary outcomes, and the contextual factors that enabled their adoption. These lessons will likely be of use to countries in other regions that are looking to either create or strengthen their own legal framework supporting access to information. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is a flagship program of the ruling UPA Government. The twin objectives of MGNREGA are to enhance the livelihood security of the rural poor by guaranteeing wage
employment for atleast 100 days in a year and building assets for the poor. Several studies show that MGNREGS is not free from the evils in the implementation of many other preceding welfare schemes implemented in a similar scale at the grass
root level, viz. corruption, misappropriation, leakages of funds and the benefits not reaching the target group. Some of the widely identified issues in Social Audits were Muster Fudging, Delays in Payments, Binami Wage-seekers, Fake Measurements and Work Duplication. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The emergence and growth of the Bangladesh RMG took place, largely, within the ambit of regulated discipline of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). In spite of its highly discretionary nature, the MFA regime, with its relative predictability, had been a "blessing in disguise" for Bangladesh. 
With the conclusion of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) under the Uruguay Round (UR) multilateral trade negotiations (1987-1993), both the context and the content of trade in T&amp;C; are set to undergo important changes. Of all the agreements negotiated in the course of the UR, the ATC is perhaps the singlemost important one from the perspective of Bangladesh. This is also true for a number of other developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). 
Given the potential impact the ATC may have on Bangladesh’s overall development prospect and on the future of the country’s apparel sector in particular, the country needs to closely monitor the implementation of the ATC. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bhutan&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic is small relative to its neighbours, with 270 cumulative reported cases since the first case was detected in 1993. Presently, an estimated 988 people (or below 0.1 percent of the adult population) are living with HIV in Bhutan, making it a low-prevalence country. A recent behavioural assessment in two major towns found evidence of high-risk behaviour among key affected populations, including MSM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National STI and HIV AIDS Prevention and Control Programme (NACP) was established in 1988, five years before HIV was first detected in the country. Bhutan&amp;rsquo;s HIV response continues to be led by the 2004 Royal Decree on HIV Prevention, delivered by the Fourth King, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, and subsequent proclamations of support. In 2005, the Fifth King, His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, advocated for abstinence and urged Bhutan&amp;rsquo;s youth to use their strength of character to reject undesirable activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality is a taboo subject in Bhutan, though younger generations are thought to be more accepting. Little is known about the nature of same-sex sexual activity in Bhutan. Anecdotes exist of sex between men occurring in army barracks, prison cells, and monk dormitories. Online chat rooms, cruising websites, and restaurants and bars are cited as key places where MSM meet in Bhutan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Bhutan reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Language matters. It impacts on how we think about ourselves, as individuals within our families and within society. As advocates and activists, we constantly use language as a tool to effect change. People living with HIV have been critical in shaping this language over the last 30 years and still play a central role in ensuring that new discourse in the HIV field does not stigmatize, but rather that it catalyzes empowerment for our community members. In this annotation, we seek to shift the language used in relation to ourselves, our medical condition, our bodies, our identities and the events we face, towards something more life-enhancing, self-affirming and positive in outlook. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The goal of this paper is to highlight the cross-sectoral importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and give the big picture of ICT in developing countries. This is done by presenting a number of successful implementations of ICT applications. The examples are organized according to a simple framework consisting of three layers, which are ICT infrastructure, sector applications and use of applications. The cases throughout the paper shall serve as a basis for creative thought and innovation in ICT in developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This booklet, prepared by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) on behalf of the UNDP-UNEP poverty-environment initiative (PEI), captures experiences of various stakeholders ranging from the government level to vulnerable groups in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malawi, Bangladesh, Tajikistan and Uruguay. These case studies examine how national and local institutional processes can promote poverty reduction and growth while addressing environmental protection. Examples include: Lao PDR’s new rulebook for foreign investment in natural resources to boost local benefits; Malawi changing course after analysing the real costs and benefits of policy choices; Bangladesh’s pioneering new 'climate change accounts' to reveal the real cost of adaptation; Tajikistan integrating poverty-environment concerns into its development planning; and Uruguay’s efforts to use the law to catalyse the transition to an inclusive green economy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The concept of inclusive economic growth (growth coupled with equality of opportunity) offers new directions in the pursuit of development. This study assesses the growth experience of 22 developing economies in Asia and the Pacific region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document demonstrates that to understand if inclusive growth is achieved, it is necessary to examine changes in opportunity and in the distribution of opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in Asia, access to opportunity is generally on the rise, and inequality in opportunity is generally in decline &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this respect, it is evident that growth of 11 Asian economies has become more inclusive &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;furthermore, a number of Asian economies have achieved the target of equality in the provision of key, basic opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there is nonetheless considerable room for further gains, particularly in some South and Southeast Asian economies, where inequality in opportunity is high&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, inequality in opportunity is generally lower in the Pacific economies studied &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;evidence of inclusive growth is found in a number of Central Asian economies, but the key challenge is to achieve a high, sustainable rate of economic growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;comparisons across countries of the inclusiveness of growth face a challenge in identifying indicators that are sufficiently meaningful in all countries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;therefore, the basis for measuring inclusive growth should ideally be tailored to each country &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a larger study which examined a broader range of indicators drawn on wider views of how surveyees interpret inclusive growth would help deepen the understanding of the inclusiveness of economic growth &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>The work was conducted for improving textile effluent quality via turbidity removal by electrocoagulation (EC) using aluminum sacrificial electrode. Effluents were treated at 30 minutes and 30 volts (30min-30V) and 60 minutes and 40 volts (60min-40V) condition in a 1000 ml reactor cell with anode distance of 4 cm. Prior to EC experiment, physico-chemical parameters of effluent were measured and turbidity level was found eight times higher than the Department of Environment (DoE) standard. Turbidity removal ranged from 53 to 96.2% and 58 to 97.5% for condition one and two, respectively. Dissolved oxygen (DO) increased satisfactorily for both conditions. Total operational cost ranged from 62.50 to 70.41 taka/m3 at 30min-30V and 159.57 to 187.7 taka/m3 at 60min-40V. Moreover, sludge formation ranged from 6.73Ã—10-4 to 8.41Ã—10-4 kg in first condition and 1.21Ã—10-3 to 1.5431Ã—10-3 kg in second one. So, EC treatment was very effective and capable of elevating quality of the textile wastewater. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Reducing gender barriers to decent work is fundamental to advancing the inclusive growth agenda in developing countries. This publication aims to offer evidence-based policy recommendations on strategies to advance gender equality in Asia through addressing persistent gender labour market gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author indicates that despite robust economic growth in the region, gender gaps persist in the labour market in terms of labour utilisation and where and how women and men work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings encompass:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gender inequalities are not only rooted in the socio-cultural norms of Asian countries but also entrenched in the policy and institutional frameworks that shape the employment opportunities of female labour force &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;while some progress has been made in past decades in advancing gender equality, women still make up the &amp;ldquo;buffer workforce&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; both within labour markets as flexible informal workers and within household as &amp;ldquo;secondary earners&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The report identifies a set of gender-responsive policies that could help provide decent work for all women and men in the region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The re-balancing policies include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;gender-focused approach to support women entrepreneurs to establish formal enterprises&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;assist women engaged in agriculture to boost rural productivity and incomes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;promote equal opportunities for girls and women to access quality education and training&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;help to reduce the overreliance of developing Asia on the informal sector to absorb its workforce during economic recessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper concludes that creating an enabling environment of equal opportunity and treatment in the labour market for both genders will contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The ability to pay for a government-led investment strategy to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) is determined by the resources available to the government through economic growth, taxation, loans, and grants. Unsustainable public debts increase poverty directly through negative impacts on economic growth as well as indirectly through cuts in spending. Hence, the issue of fiscal debt sustainability is critical for achieving the MDGs. In this paper, we use the debt projection module of SimSIP Debt to project the evolution of Bangladeshâ€™s public debt over a 15-year horizon (from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2021) under three different macroeconomic scenarios and two different financing scenarios of an ambitious government-led investment strategy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>One of the main economic reasons behind regional trade blocks is to allow their regional members to benefit from economic cooperation and comparative advantages. In 1980, Bangladesh had suggested a regional cooperative body of South Asian leaders, which then led to the establishment of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985, the adoption of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) in 1993, and the agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in 2004. This paper focuses on a review of the progress made with SAFTA, what Bangladesh’s prospects are in SAFTA, and how SAFTA can be made more active. It provides the historical background about the various initiatives within South Asia, reviews the actual trade data, and reviews the main trade restrictions within SAFTA. It also provides a set of recommendations based on this analysis. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events, making more geographic places inhospitable to human habitation and secure livelihoods. This report presents a detailed picture of the potential impacts of climate change on migration in Asia and the Pacific. It draws upon a wealth of research to provide policymakers with informed analysis of an emerging phenomenon requiring urgent attention by governments and the international community. The report also suggests that climate-induced migration should be seen not only as a threat to human wellbeing but also as a potential tool to promote human adaptation to climate change. It concludes that by taking actions today, governments can reduce the likelihood of future humanitarian crises and maximise the possibilities that people can remain in their communities or – should deteriorating environmental conditions make that impractical – that they have the real option to relocate to a more secure place with livelihood options. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The was a prospective community cohort aimed to identify clinical predictors of mortality in HIV-2 infected individuals that may be used in place of CD4 count or plasma viral load to guide treatment management in resource limited settings. Participants were followed up for 7years. In 2003, 146 HIV-2 infected individuals were examined. Over the next 7years, 44 died. BMI &amp;lt;18.5kg/sq metres was associated with a crude mortality hazard ratio[HR] of 1.9 (95% CI; 1.0-3.9, p=0.08). MUAC &amp;lt; 230mm in women and &amp;lt;240mm in men was also associated with an elevated mortality HR, though statistical evidence was weak. WHO clinical stage and WHO performance scale was not associated with mortality. In conclusion, baseline BMI, MUAC, WHO stage and WHO performance scale were not strong or statistically significant predictors of mortality among HIV-2-infected individuals. CD4 count and PVL are more reliable tools, when available for the management of HIV-2-infected patients in the community setting &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Currently worldwide an effective utilization of ICT is in the designing and development of applications for the delivering the education in general, which can be organized to make knowledge assessable to almost everyone and as per the individuals‟ availability and requirements, irrespective of their locations. Further, it is proved to be useful to access a greater flexibility in the field of teaching and learning to meet out the development of cognitive skills and learning styles as per the need of individual learners‟. Currently a great paradigm shift in the field of technical education system is noticeable because ICTs have options to customize delivery of education. This need of a common men id fulfilled as per individual needs as opposed to the traditional system, where, individuals is dependent of as to how the education is delivered. In the web based learning environment the teacher‟s role is more of a mediator and the students gain greater control over their
own learning. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to climate change impacts including sea level rise, invasive species, ocean acidification, changes in rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and changing hazard regimes including hurricanes, floods and drought. Given high dependencies in Caribbean SIDS on natural resources for livelihoods, a focus on ecosystems and their interaction with people is essential for climate change adaptation. Increasingly, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches are being highlighted as an approach to address climate change impacts. Specifically, EbA encourages the use of local and external knowledge about ecosystems to identify climate change adaptation approaches. This paper critically reviews EbA in Caribbean SIDS, focusing on the need to integrate local and external knowledge. An analysis of current EbA in the Caribbean is undertaken alongside a review of methodologies used to integrate local and external expertise for EbA. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Government of Bangladesh is committed to ensuring access of its population to adequate healthcare services. However, substantial inequalities exist in maternal and child health outcomes in Bangladesh, with child and maternal mortality rates being much higher in the poorest families than in the non-poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current paper clarifies that the major factor driving this inequality is the perceived cost of obtaining treatment at public and modern providers. In addition, the reduced likelihood of poorer and less educated families recognising their ill children as sick and needing treatment is another reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the treatment of children at Ministry of Health and Family Welfare facilities is as or more expensive as at private doctors, and much more expensive than at pharmacies and traditional providers &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;higher costs of treatment explain why most sick children are taken to pharmacies or traditional providers, where they are unlikely to receive appropriate treatment&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;overall out-of-pocket expenditures by families to obtain medical care frequently impoverish them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author suggests that if the government wishes to target additional resources to improve access for the poor, an effective option would be to substantially reduce their out-of-pocket expenditure burden. This can be achieved by increasing the supply of medicines in public facilities through increased budget allocations and more efficient supply systems. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The impact of climate change and rising seas is currently affecting huge number of people, and Pacific islands are on the frontline. This briefing paper discusses the human impact of climate change in the Pacific, and looks into how adaptation measures should be about meeting existing and future development challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document illustrates:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;serious climatic adverse impacts are already being experienced in the Pacific, including coastal erosion, flooding, coral bleaching and more frequent and intense extreme weather events&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;compounding the problem of rising seas and retreating land is rapid population growth, placing increasing pressures on already limited infrastructure and resources&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;relocation is not a simple solution, and adaptation measures will need to be aligned to long term development planning and approached as a whole of government consideration &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The paper concludes the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the need to move towards sources of clean, renewable energy more is mostly urgent in the Pacific islands - the Pacific can lead the world in this relevance &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, rapid and significant reductions in global emissions and switching to renewable energy sources are as the best options to help the region&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;concerning the modern technologies needed to make Pacific renewable energy sources more viable, regional collaboration could help with bulk purchasing to lower costs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, harmonising donor spending will be even more critical as huge sums are made available for climate change adaptation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;equally important, land owners should be driven to avoid cutting down trees in the Pacific, where the region has suffered devastating logging of forests &lt;/li&gt;

    <dcterms:abstract>As ICT is becoming an integral element for educational reforms and innovations in primary and secondary schools, this situation calls for an enhancement of pre-service education on ICT for prospective teachers. This paper focuses on issues relating to pre-service teacher education on ICT. Problems with existing approaches to pre-service training on ICT are first addressed. Cases that represent partial solutions to the existing problems are introduced. Based upon our own experiences in ICT training for pre-service and in-service teachers, an integrated curriculum for pre-service teacher education on ICT is proposed within the framework of cultures. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Government intervention in the market economy is a controversial issue due to the philosophical differences in the political ideologies of the decision-makers. There are some areas which are mainly controlled by the government because of its superiority and the structure; these are: ensuring social safety and security, providing basic needs and compensating negative externalities, etc. There are two broad swings of the pendulum regarding the practice of government intervention. Some believe that market failure requires government interference while others disagree. This is an ongoing debate whether government is eligible to intervene in the economy and if so then to what extent. The existing research findings do not come up with a decisive solution in this regard. This study is a critical appreciation based on the arguments of different thinkers in favour and against government intervention. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The ability of ICT to change the way people do things is either hidden in internal processes—such as how a government office manages data collection—or manifest in the end product. While the level and nature of the benefits of ICT may differ for every stakeholder, there is a consensus of what ICT can help provide to governments, businesses, and citizens: faster access to relevant information, an efficient means for communication, an enhanced ability to make informed decisions, and a voice to otherwise unheard peoples. As these cases from ADB would show, access to ICT alone will not result in significant, lasting change. It is the adoption of appropriate technology, paralleled with an enabling policy environment, a responsive and needs-based approach, improved individual and institutional capacity, nurtured partnerships with key stakeholders, leadership by local champions, effectively managed change, and sustained support that make the difference. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Pakistan. Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic is driven by key affected populations. In 1999, Pakistan, in partnership with UNAIDS, determined that it would prevent a generalised epidemic by targeting key vulnerable groups. Subsequent surveillance activities revealed disproportionate HIV risk among injecting drug users and hijra and male sex workers, who exhibit HIV prevalence of 37.8, 7.2 and 3.1 percent, respectively. Targeted HIV prevention interventions among these three groups continue to be the cornerstone of Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s HIV response. Hijra and male sex workers are commonly considered MSM by Pakistani AIDS authorities and so determining whether data correspond to MSM who self-identify as male and are not sex workers is at times difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex other than that between husband and wife is strictly forbidden by Islamic law. Consequently, overt expressions of homosexuality carry the risks of social stigmatisation, class discrimination, ostracism from family and friends, and extreme physical punishment under current sodomy laws. Yet sex between men appears to exist among segments of society beyond those included in definitions of hijra and male sex workers. More overt examples of male-to-male sexual behavior include the practice of keeping boys for sexual gratification observed among rich elderly men in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be important in the implementation of the forthcoming national strategic plan for efforts intended for MSM to cater to the specific needs of various subgroups. Significant overlap exists between MSM and other key affected populations such as migrants, truck drivers, and drug users. There exists an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of prevention efforts through better integration and nuance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot&amp;nbsp;provides more information&amp;nbsp;about priorities for Pakistan reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This 2-page research summary shares findings from research conducted by BBC Media Action about the most current pressing issues affecting Kenyans to inform the multi-media debate programme Sema Kenya (Speak Kenya). Some of the most current pressing issues identified by the research as affecting Kenyans were unemployment, the high cost of living, negative ethnicity (loyalty to one's ethnic group above loyalty to the state), poverty, and corruption. The inaccessibility of Kenyan politicians and the threat of retaliation were viewed as the principle barriers to Kenyans being able to question and receive answers from their leaders. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper aims to provide a new way of looking at ICT as a central driver of economic transformation and global competition. It aims to raise awareness of the ICT revolution and its implications for development, and offers a menu of possibilities and applications. It explores how ICT offers new approaches and platforms to the region’s development challenges—and how4 ICT can be deployed to address the core challenges. In doing so, it aims to bridge the current divide between policy makers, development economists, and ICT specialists. The paper starts by outlining the broad development challenges facing North African countries, which can be most effectively addressed by a development path. Then it briefly outlines the ICT landscape for North Africa and the Middle East (MENA). The paper then proposes and defines a paradigm for development, enabled by the ICT revolution: open, smart and inclusive (OSI) development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Oxfam report, based on a case study on Vietnam, assesses the labour standards in Unilever’s operations and wider supply chain and compares the findings with the company's high-level policy commitments. The company co-operated fully with the study, providing access to its staff, operations, data and suppliers. The study focused on issues which are important to workers but difficult for companies to measure and manage: freedom of association and collective bargaining; a living wage; and working hours and contract labour. The report finds that Unilever has made a commitment to social responsibility by adopting the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP), but human and labour rights are absent from the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. The report makes a number of recommendations for Unilever ranging from adjusting policies and business model to deliver better quality jobs for workers to integrating measurable targets for labour rights and job quality to a public reporting process. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This Guidebook, part of the ICT4D series produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through its Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP), is designed to provide policy-makers the necessary tools, information and knowledge to facilitate the formulation and adoption of ICT policies and strategies. Through the examination of vital sectors and case study analysis of applied policies and strategies implemented in the Asia-Pacific region, this publication provides tangible examples and lessons for policy-makers and practitioners involved in the field. The debate on ICT has permanently shifted from ‘why’ ICT for Development, to ‘how’ comprehensive and holistic ICT policies can unleash human potential and enhance people’s capabilities to improve their lives. Sound ICT policies that are truly pro-poor must be an indispensable part of national development strategies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study discusses the rapid modernization that the forces of ICT and globalization have generated in India affect the behaviour of Indians - in education, economics and politics. Changes are taking place in some parts of India rapidly. But I do not visualize that this will alter India’s basic values of a simple life, family system, caste, ethnic and religious affiliations, attachment to folklores and folktales and music and dance patterns – not so substantially as to alter the basic Indian personality. The age-old India’s civilizational strengths of innovation, absorption, adaptation and respect for diversity of views, including the forces generated by the contemporary freedom struggle under Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership and the ongoing democratic experience would keep the distinct Indian personality intact. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper describes an approach to measuring the effectiveness of the national systems that underpin public climate finance delivery. It assesses three interlinked elements of government administration: the policy environment that supports climate change expenditures; the institutional architecture that determines relevant roles and responsibilities; and the public financial system through which climate change related expenditures are channelled. The paper identifies key principles of effective climate finance delivery for each of these elements, and formulates criteria and indicators that reflect a progression towards compliance with those principles. Collectively, these principles, criteria and indicators offer an explicit framework across the realms of policy, institutions and public expenditure that can be further adapted in response to specific country circumstances. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>How are environmental problems and climate change issues covered and framed by Nigerian newspapers? This content analysis of systematically sampled, 438 issues from 4380 issues of four selected dailies between 2007 and 2009, reveals dominance of climate politics/economics issues (61.2 per cent), foreign sourcing of reports (63.4 per cent), straight news formatting of reports (83.6 per cent) and framing in terms of mitigation (55.2 per cent). The study concludes that the coverage and framing constrain opportunities for popular participation in climate change discourse. To improve the situation, the study argues that Nigerian newspapers should broaden the scope of climate change coverage and framing, widen local sourcing of reports, diversify the formats of reporting and frame the issues more in the terms of adaptation to increase the involvement of Nigerian people in climate change discourse. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper targets individuals and organizations engaged in providing ICT literacy education. The first section provides a situational analysis of ICT usage in the Asia-Pacific region, both to examine current dominant thrusts in ICT literacy education and to serve as background for the strategy framework presented in this report. The second section, then, details this framework. It defines goals, objectives, and approaches, as well as discusses conceptual and operational measures for promoting ICT literacy development throughout the Asia-Pacific region. By so doing, this paper helps contribute to Asia Pacific Information Network (APIN) ICT literacy programming efforts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Viet Nam. Men who have sex with men (MSM)&amp;nbsp;in Viet Nam are at disproportionately high risk of HIV transmission. Research suggests that this is due in large part to multiple sexual partners, low condom use and low perceptions of risk. Not all MSM are at equal risk, however. HIV prevalence among MSM was found to be significantly higher in cities than in rural areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a revised law on HIV passed by the Viet Nam National Assembly listed &amp;lsquo;homosexual people&amp;rsquo; among the high-risk groups prioritised for HIV prevention programming. This represented the first time that MSM were recognised by the government of Viet Nam. However, funding for HIV services targeting MSM comes almost exclusively from donor programmes. As donors reduce their support to Viet Nam in the coming years, it will be critical for domestically funded programmes to target MSM as a population at high risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men who have sex with men generally keep their sexual behaviours hidden in Viet Nam due to widespread stigma and discrimination. In 2002,Viet Nam&amp;rsquo;s state-run media declared homosexuality a &amp;lsquo;social evil&amp;rsquo; equally as harmful as drug use and prostitution. Among the consequences of stigma and discrimination towards MSM are continuing programmatic neglect, relative difficulty reaching MSM, and false or low perceptions of HIV risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities of MSM in Viet Nam have been active in the response since as early as 2005, participating formally and informally in national and regional networks, including a national MSM and HIV working group founded in 2006. While there have been important indications of recognition and commitment to MSM in the HIV response, a coherent strategy for targeting MSM, including routine HIV surveillance among MSM, reporting of homosexual sex as a risk factor for transmission in case reporting, and ensuring meaningful participation in HIV response planning, remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides more information about priorities for Viet Nam reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

Seven recommendations made following findings from these countries are: strengthening and increased utilization of existing nutrition architectures and coordination mechanisms; mainstreaming and integrating nutrition in relevant sector policies; increased advocacy focusing on the importance of the life-course perspective particularly on nutrition interventions from pre-conception until the first two years of life; translation of national nutrition policies into programmatic actions; increased capacity building on long and short terms;strengthening of community-based outreach using existing channels;and strengthening of national nutrition surveillance systems to ensure adequate use of data for monitoring &amp;amp; evaluation &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

It argues that despite there being little clarity on how the post-2015 process will link to actual policy making, many women&amp;rsquo;s rights advocates see the process as a possible opportunity to reframe the development model and fight for a more democratic, inclusive and accountable international development system that can tackle the structural factors behind poverty, inequality and crises. It states the importance of joining the post-2015 process to others such as the review of the International Conference on Population and Development or the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It also points out that the post-2015 process should be genuinely participatory, involving civil society at all stages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article lists some of the ways that women&amp;rsquo;s rights groups have been engaging with the process in different regions, for example through the Africa women&amp;rsquo;s regional civil society consultation and the regional dialogue on sustainable development and the post-2015 agenda in Bangkok. By taking part in such arenas, women&amp;rsquo;s groups and gender activists have an opportunity to influence broader civil society messages, the article argues. &lt;br /&gt;Rather than rushing to develop new development goals, care should be taken to address fundamental questions around the type of development we want to see and the ideology that underpins it. The article makes the interesting point that the messages and demands of ongoing mobilisations and struggles such as Indignados, Occupy and others should be introduced into the post-2015 discussion, as a way of ensuring that inclusive development strategies emerge from local resistance and struggles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Ecuador’s innovative proposal for not developing its Yasun&amp;iacute;-Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini (Yasun&amp;iacute;-ITT) oil fields presents an alternative strategy for resolving the conservation versus extractive industry development dilemma. In the spirit of co-responsibility, Ecuador asked the rest of the world to contribute up to 50% of the income it would forgo by choosing conservation. This case study describes this innovative proposal and its relevance to current extractive industries and land use concerns, and finally, discusses some interesting questions for debate that the case raises. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Governments and donor agencies are under increasing pressure to show hard evidence that their interventions are effective and good value for money. Anti-corruption is a challenging field in this regard, with few evidence-based models to draw upon, so both the design and the evaluation of programmes need to be supported by good analytical frameworks. The theory of change (ToC) approach focuses on how and why an initiative works. Constructing a ToC enables government and donor staff to identify the logic underpinning their programmes and clarify how interventions are expected to lead to the intended results. The paper presents a user-friendly five-step methodology for building a theory of change for a programme or project. It highlights the importance of preconditions, factors that must be in place for the intervention to work as intended, distinguishing between those preconditions that can be addressed by the programme design and those that cannot. Finally, the paper provides general and sector-specific guidance based on case studies of programmes in three areas: anti-corruption authorities, civil society work, and public sector reforms. Adding complexity as well as realism, the theory of change methodology is a valuable tool for designing, implementing, and evaluating anti-corruption reforms. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Rapid change in the Arctic resulting from climate change is threatening ecosystems and providing new development opportunities including easier access to oil, gas and minerals. The UNEP Year Book 2013 shows that changes in the Arctic will have consequences far beyond this fragile region and that they require an urgent international response. It also reports on the spike in rhino and elephant poaching in Africa, growing urban environmental challenges and the accelerating momentum to tackle short-lived climate pollutants. The report highlights that the volume of chemicals in the world continues to grow, with a shift in production from developed to developing countries. To meet the goal of producing and using chemicals in ways that minimise significant impacts on health and the environment by 2020, there need to be reinforced efforts to reduce the use of toxic chemicals, promote safer alternatives and build capacity for sound chemicals management. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

The high frequency of decreased haemoglobin level among the regular voulntary blood donors found in this study suggests a need for a more accurate laboratory trial,since hemaglobin alone is not sufficient for detecting and excluding blood donors with iron deficiency without anemia. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The proposed National Health and Population Information Center (NHPIC) may work as a sketch for establishing a need based system that will ensure free flow of information from the policy level to the extreme end of implementation of HNPSP. During design of the system due attention has been paid to the socio-economic, technical, financial, infrastructural, policy and administrative issues of the country. Thus, the system is expected to be realistic in information system for the HNPSP in Bangladesh. Every plan has a ‘movable horizon’, i.e. it is never definitive but can and should be improved in the light of experience, and will inevitably have to be adapted to the changing situation. It is important, therefore, that the plan should include the provision for evaluation and amendment as and when necessary. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Nepal. &lt;br /&gt;Nepal&amp;rsquo;s National Centre for AIDS and STD Control has officially recognised MSM as an important driver of the country&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic since at least 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections among the general population and injecting drug users have declined in recent years. Meanwhile, infections among MSM and female sex workers appear stable. Nepal&amp;rsquo;s HIV programme is recognised as a &amp;lsquo;P1&amp;rsquo; or first priority in the country&amp;rsquo;s Interim National Development Plan. The Government of Nepal prioritises P1 programmes over all other non-P1 programmes when determining budget allocations. However, there are popular concerns regarding the sustainability of Nepal&amp;rsquo;s HIV financing mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage among key affected populations has improved over the years as a result of focused interventions and increased community-based organisation involvement. Community-level interventions, some of which involve MSM, are central to Nepal&amp;rsquo;s National HIV/AIDS Strategy, 2011&amp;ndash;2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSM are stigmatised and socially marginalised in Nepal. The Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a prominent advocacy group for the rights of LGBTI Nepalis, reports of a prevalent &amp;lsquo;double stigma,&amp;rsquo; or stigma related to sexual orientation and HIV infection. Faced with continued discrimination and threats of violent attacks, &amp;lsquo;metis,&amp;rsquo; or persons of the third gender in Nepal, sometimes take to hospices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several policy and legal advancements have been made with regard to MSM and other key affected populations. Sunil Babu Pant, Director of BDS and member of the Contituent Assembly and Parliament of Nepal, led a campaign that demanded an end to all kinds of discrimination and violence against LGBTI populations. In 2007, the Supreme Court of Nepal ruled in favour of recognising the third gender in national identification cards, a same sex marriage law, and ending or amending discriminatory laws against LGBTI populations. The ruling allegedly led to a reduction in violence against LGBTI populations and greater acceptance among segments of society, media, and government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepal&amp;rsquo;s political instability continues to be a major barrier to an effective national response. It threatens sustained leadership in the national HIV response and risks a reversal of progress on meeting Millennium Development Goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Nepal reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAC Working Paper 52&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kojo Amanor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the differences in Brazilian and Chinese investments in Ghana. It examines the extent to which the framework of South-South cooperation illuminates or masks these changing relationships and their political economy dimensions. The paper also addresses the social vision of development embedded in frameworks of South- South cooperation and whether they harmonise with Ghanaian agrarian sector visions and societal developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent, framing and structure of Chinese and Brazilian investments in Ghana are examined. The changing political economy of the agrarian sector within Ghana is outlined, as well as the changing framework of agrarian policy in the context of market liberalisation and rise of agribusiness. The specificities of Chinese agricultural investments in Ghana are examined in relation to its wider investments and interests in Ghana. Brazilian investments within the Ghanaian agricultural sector are examined in relation to the expansion of Brazilian agribusiness and its integration into the global economy. The paper discusses the impact of such developments on Ghanaian agriculture and society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper explores the impact of climate change and variability on agricultural productivity in the communal area of Bikita, Zimbabwe, and examines the adaptation and mitigation strategies of communal farmers. It determines that the adverse impacts of climate change are felt heavily by the poor communal farmers who are directly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Reported signs of climate variability in Bikita included late and unpredictable rains, high temperatures (heat waves), successive drought, shortening rainfall seasons and seasonal changes in the timing of rainfall. The paper argues that climate change has compounded the vulnerability of peasant farmers in the drought-prone district of Bikita, increasing food insecurity and poverty. However, the findings of the study reveal that communal farmers have not been passive victims, but they have responded to climate variability through various adaptation and mitigation strategies both individually and collectively. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Across the Pacific the internet is nullifying the distance and strengthening social bonds. This paper underlines that the region&amp;rsquo;s leaders are notably absent, but the online conversation goes on without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The document notes that wireless networks are significantly cheaper to roll out than cable-based ones, especially in such region lacking significant road and power networks. Identically, the author argues that there is great scope for Pacific leaders to find ways to give focus to the emerging power of online communication and collaboration. However, re-purposing internet tools to island needs will require a degree of ingenuity and attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key messages are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the internet is here to stay; leaders who accept it and engage with an increasingly connected citizenry will benefit&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;some may see this trend as a threat, but it&amp;rsquo;s manageable, especially by getting ahead of the game and helping, not hindering, this proliferation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;open competition and a strong independent regulatory environment generate the most benefit for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;healthy competition also allows government to maintain balance in an economic sector whose value will only increase&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;online social networks have a lot in common with traditional society, which gives Pacific islanders a distinct edge as they learn to apply new tools to age-old tradition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Still, the author believes there are few indications that the social networks will soon sparkle a Pacific version of the so-called Arab Spring; voices and concerns across the Pacific are diverse and often highly localised. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This prospective study aims to describe the neurological and neurocognitive deficits in HIV-infected children and the short-term effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the observed deficit. 39 children were evaluated before the start of HAART and 30 were reassessed 6month later. The subjects were evaluated with a range of cognitive tests used in everyday clinical practice. At the start of HAART, no child had cranial nerve or cerebellar dysfunction, but 33.3% had evidence of motor dysfunction. By 6months, 1 child had developed cerebellar dysfunction, but there was no statistically significant change in the frequency of motor dysfunction. mean baseline performances on cognitive testing were generally subnormal. Between 33% and 81% of the children recorded subnormal intelligence quotients on various cognitive tests. Mean performances did not change significantly after 6months of HAART. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study finds that tropical forests are unlikely to disappear as a result of the predicted rise of greenhouse gases this century. However, assessing potential future carbon loss from tropical forests is important for evaluating the efficacy of programmes for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. This study presents a systematic exploration of various sources of uncertainty, along with uncertainty arising from different emissions scenarios for all three main tropical forest regions: the Americas (i.e. Amazonia and Central America), Africa and Asia. Using simulations with 22 climate models and the MOSES–TRIFFID land surface scheme, the study found that in all but one simulation, rainforests across the regions retained their carbon stocks even as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration increased. The study, therefore, concludes that despite uncertainties, there seems to be evidence of forest resilience for all three regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents the report of workshops held in 2010 in East and West Africa. The workshops were aimed primarily at promoting network among policy makers, researchers, scientists, academicians and other stakeholders in nutrition/health and agriculture. The objectives of the workshops were to review the performance of nutrition and agriculture coordination bodies, projects and processes; to discuss the implementation of policies and interventions put in place to improve nutritional outcomes; and to consider how the information presented at the workshop could be implemented in order to improve nutritional outcomes for the vulnerable populations in the country. Key questions were addressed which include how policy makers and program designers can be empowered to monitor and implement nutrition in the National Development Plan, how synergies can be established between the Agriculture and Nutrition sectors amongst others. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper will attempt to present some practitioner perspectives, insights and experiences which the GeSCI gained from its work in and with partner countries in three continents. The main issues related to Information Communications Technologies (ICTs) in education, as well as the insights provided on the challenges and lessons learned, are drawn from GeSCI’s work in partner countries and from the literature. Significant attention is being paid globally as to how ICTs might be used in schools, colleges and universities to facilitate teaching and learning as well as supporting continuing professional development of pre-service and in-service teachers, teacher educators and lecturers in technology use. ICT in education presents many poor countries with great opportunities, though at the same time presents considerable challenges with regard to infrastructure, cost, sustainability, optimal use and making teaching and learning meaningful for students. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper argues that the world faces a number of global crises which reflect the failures of the dominant model of development and economic progress. This model ignores human rights and the ecological limits of the global ecosystem, and considers poverty as a primarily technical challenge in which categories of inequality and social justice are neglected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a response, the Civil Society Reflection Group on Global Development Perspectives brought together 18 civil society activists and scholars from different disciplines to draw lessons from the current crises, looking beyond conventional development concepts and goals, questioning the models and measures of development and social progress, and presenting alternatives. For example, when thinking about indicators and goals, the report suggests moving beyond GNP/GDP as a primary indicator, and instead focusing on equity and distribution, well being, human rights and sustainability. Ideas for progression include emphasising progressive taxation so that rich individuals, transnational corporations and large landowners can be taxed accordingly, and strengthening participatory, gender and human rights budgeting initiatives, ensuring that budgets are complying with government&amp;rsquo;s obligation to promote, protect and fulfil the economic, social and cultural human rights of present and future generations. The report also recommends focusing on small producers and ecological farming, since these farming methods secure long-term productivity, increase resilience, conserve the soil and protect biodiversity. Such methods have the potential to produce more food per hectare than industrial agriculture but implementation will require a significant shift in investment. Gender sensitive policies are an essential part of increasing and stabilising this local food production. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in India. &lt;br /&gt;India accounts for approximately half of Asia&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic with approximately 2.4 million people living with HIV. In 2009, an estimated 87.4 percent of all infections were related to heterosexual sex and 1.7 percent was related to sex between men. India&amp;rsquo;s national HIV epidemic is concentrated, though a functional distinction is made between &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;bridge&amp;rsquo; populations. Both receive focused support in India&amp;rsquo;s National AIDS Control Programme but the intensity of the intervention varies between the two and across geographic areas. The 50 percent decline in incidence attributed to intensified programmatic attention in six high- prevalence states serves as possible evidence of the value of this approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the third National AIDS Control Programme (NACP &amp;ndash; III) articulated the need for enhanced programmatic attention to MSM and was the first to outline a strategy for HIV prevention interventions targeted at hijra and male sex workers. It is thought that funding for targeted prevention interventions for MSM, male sex workers, and hijra is insufficient to meet basic needs for condoms and water-based lubricant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of HIV services in India are managed by community- based organisations. A 2008 organisation mapping exercise found that 65 percent of all organisations and networks working with MSM in India are community-based. A handful of LGBT-oriented organisations and networks also play a key role in the formulation of national policy and guidelines related to HIV. They include: the Indian Network for Sexual Minorities (INFOSEM), and MANAS Bangla in West Bengal state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas MSM are viewed as a &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; population under NACP &amp;ndash; III, there is emerging evidence of MSM as a &amp;lsquo;bridge&amp;rsquo; population. The proportion of MSM that report recent sex with women varies greatly across states and reaches as high as 66 percent. Yet female partners of MSM are excluded from information, education, and communication programmes, a cornerstone of India&amp;rsquo;s HIV prevention strategy. India&amp;rsquo;s National AIDS Control Programme has demonstrated remarkable leadership in responding to the HIV prevention needs of MSM. Future policy advancements may depend on the extent of overlap between MSM and other risk groups and the ability for policy leaders to quickly recognise the need for greater spending on targeted programmes for MSM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for India reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A two-stage methodology for identifying children with disabilities was employed in the Kishoreganj district of Bangladesh in 2001-2002. Ordered and generalized logit regressions were used to examine the correlation of childhood impairment and disability with a number of potential risk factors.Children with consanguineous parents were 43.5% more likely to have an impairment; and poor children were 23.1% more likely. Maternal education reduced the chances of impairments developing into disabilities by 35%. Differences in risk factors existed between mild and severe disabilities. For example, boys were 66% more likely to have mild disabilities but not severe ones. Consanguinity and poverty are major factors associated with impairments, but maternal education might be an important tool towards limiting the probability of those impairments progressing to disabilities. Evidence also suggests significant difference between severe and mild disabilities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the era of modernisation and globalisation the electronic dependency and utilisation has been emerging as one of the driving force towards economic growth and development. Specifically, this scenario may not be much significant in the developed economies but it is as important area of concern in education, governance, commerce and so on. This paper highlights the importance of IT in implementation of SMART government in the State of Punjab; it is one of the leading states of India in all terms of advancement. It discusses various e-governance initiatives undertaken by the state of Punjab and suggests various measures for their better implementation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This evaluation was commissioned by Oxfam GB to measure the impact of the We Can campaign, which ran from 2004-2010 in six countries across south Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). The overall goal of the We Can programme was to reduce the social acceptance of violence against women across the six countries. There were four objectives: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; A fundamental shift in social attitudes and beliefs that support VAW &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; A collective and visible stand by different sections of the community against VAW &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; A popular movement to end all VAW &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; A range of local, national and regional alliances to address VAW &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be done by mobilising five million &amp;lsquo;change makers&amp;rsquo; who would go on to influence 50 million &amp;lsquo;ordinary men and women&amp;rsquo;. The inspiration for this was the Raising Voices project in Uganda. In the first stage of the programme, women and men were encouraged to join the campaign by making a &amp;lsquo;change maker pledge&amp;rsquo; to &amp;ldquo;(i) not tolerate or perpetrate violence against women under any circumstances, and (ii) to motivate at least ten people to help prevent and end gender discrimination and violence against women&amp;rdquo; (2011:9). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there were large scale appeals through communication campaigns including posters, comic strips, newsletters and video clips all &amp;ldquo;designed to trigger reflection among audiences unfamiliar with concepts of gender equality&amp;rdquo; (2011:10). Materials were gathered into &amp;lsquo;change maker kits&amp;rsquo; to aid the change makers in their roles. Campaign alliances were also an important element of We Can. In each country alliances were formed at national or state level according to what was appropriate in that context; &amp;ldquo;the campaign allies had much leeway in developing their mobilisation strategies &amp;ndash; within a joint, clearly articulated regional strategy&amp;rdquo; (2011:5). The combination of these elements meant that We Can was very different to other Oxfam GB campaigns which have focused on rallying support for specific policy objectives, because it &amp;ldquo;triggered gradual, open-ended personal development processes across all social strata&amp;rdquo; (2011:5). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaluation conclusions fall into the areas of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact. The key findings in these areas were: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Relevance &lt;br /&gt;The We Can campaign was highly relevant to the needs of its audiences and participants, because it: &lt;br /&gt;o Addressed major impediments to human development in south Asia &lt;br /&gt;o Complemented previous and parallel efforts &lt;br /&gt;o Brought the issue of VAW to new audiences &lt;br /&gt;o Had a well articulated and coherent theory of change containing good practice in VAW prevention &lt;br /&gt;o Was context sensitive and devised as a regional initiative &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Effectiveness &lt;br /&gt;We Can was effectively developed and implemented through campaign alliances, however lack of data and variation in implementation in each country made effectiveness hard to measure. &lt;br /&gt;o Causing a fundamental shift in social norms is a more distant goal, and it is too early to speak of a &amp;lsquo;social movement&amp;rsquo;, but significant progress has been made in localised contexts including highly traditional communities and regions with armed conflict, and among local decision makers and their constituencies. &lt;br /&gt;o It can be safely assumed that 1.4 million change makers have engaged in activism and triggered 21 million conversations on VAW and women&amp;rsquo;s rights. &lt;br /&gt;o Broad, diverse alliances have taken a stand against VAW and work on VAW has been mainstreamed into mixed and rural organisations. &lt;br /&gt;o We Can monitoring systems failed to capture the scope and complexity of the campaign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Efficiency &lt;br /&gt;The resources mobilised for the campaign were commensurate with its duration, scale and nature. Considerable expenditure on learning was justified, but regular monitoring systems were incomplete and of uneven quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Sustainability &lt;br /&gt;Campaign allies in at least four countries agree that We Can is worth continuing and four out of six We Can national secretariats were still operational with Oxfam&amp;rsquo;s support after the end of the campaign, but national alliance strategies beyond 2011 were vague on funding and campaign management, and secretariats were struggling with running costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Impact &lt;br /&gt;o We Can demonstrably contributed to changing attitudes &amp;ndash; in broad public awareness, and in change makers&amp;rsquo; personal development and their external activism. &lt;br /&gt;o Work against VAW has been mainstreamed into development organisations, schools, police and local governance institutions. &lt;br /&gt;o Attitudinal and institutional changes are likely to contribute to reducing the incidence of VAW, although the exact scope of We Can&amp;rsquo;s impact on this cannot be measured. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evaluation report goes on to make a number of recommendations, including: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; In work on attitudes and social norms, obtain expert support from practice oriented specialists in social and development psychology, so as to build robust, evidence based conceptual frameworks for effective planning, monitoring and reporting. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Develop appropriate, evolving monitoring, learning and documentation systems that respond to participants needs and facilitate reporting to donors and other stakeholders. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Create opportunities for learning and joint reflection among We Can allies through meetings, exchange visits and virtual platforms. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Create frequent opportunities for &amp;lsquo;change makers&amp;rsquo; to continue transforming their lives and influencing others &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Support alliances to continue to recruit a new generation of &amp;lsquo;change makers&amp;rsquo; of quality rather than quantity &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Think about life after We Can: &amp;ldquo;How can allies continue to support the individual and community dynamisms We Can may have created in the future? At what point should the alliances be dissolved or turned into something different? How can those who have integrated We Can into the programmes of their organisations continue to exchange experience and coordinate activities? What needs to happen to develop a broad, inclusive movement to end VAW?&amp;rdquo; (2011:35). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The White Paper adopts two very different approaches to governance. In other countries, especially developing countries, governance is problematic, something that needs to be addressed to deal with instability and potential security threats. This is governance in the broad political sense of the word, nationally and internationally. The White Paper discussion of governance within the Defence organisation is about structures and processes (accountability, performance management, assurance); that is, an organisational or “corporate governance” approach. The divergence between the two approaches is huge, but not surprising given the lack of any established definition of governance in the scholarly literature and the variety of interpretations of the term among different disciplines. What is interesting is the implicit assumption embodied in the White Paper that governance is difficult abroad but tractable at home. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The study was conducted in Tumulia Union of Kaligong Upazila under Gazipur district. The findings revealed that the overage level of income from the vegetable production of the three categories: landless with homestead, marginal and small farm size. The variables like farm size and annual family income of the women-members had low association with the extent of vegetable production. However, full achievement of the target program could not be made due to inadequate irrigation facilities, economic hardship, and low market price of vegetable and poor rood communication and transportation facilities. These problems were probably some of the reasons for not favorable attitude among the women-members for the expansion of vegetable cultivation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is an attempt to review the e-government web initiatives in Bangladesh from the perspective of citizens’ needs and benefits. It offers a cross-angle analysis on how governmental existing policies and guidelines are adept to steer public sector’s web initiatives in the country, what contents and features are currently available in public websites, and to what extent users find those websites useful for them. Focus of the paper remains on how e-government websites are currently attributed to serve and engage citizens. It has been studied that public sector web initiatives in Bangladesh tend to pose to the legacy of traditional governance than e-governance. The concept of engaging citizens and serving people through innovative uses of the Internet are not yet portrayed in the web initiatives of the public offices. Nevertheless, an upward trend is noticeable in this context. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This guide provides specific programming advice for USAID staff. It is split into two main parts; setting the context and rationale and actions. It notes that evidence suggests rates of GBV are highest in contexts where social norms support gender inequality. It argues that &amp;ldquo;from a public health perspective, community-level risk factors may be the most helpful for identifying promising ways to reduce violence against women&amp;rdquo; (2006:8). It lists some guiding principles for GBV programming in the area of health: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Ensure that all initiatives respect survivors&amp;rsquo; safety and autonomy &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Ensure the relevance and appropriateness of interventions to the local setting &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Employ both a public health and a human rights perspective &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Encourage multi-sectoral interventions at multiple levels &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Invest in evaluation &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second part on rationale and actions, the guide looks at: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How community mobilisation programmes can address gender-based violence. These should: &lt;br /&gt;o Integrate community mobilisation around GBV into existing health and development programmes &lt;br /&gt;o Reduce tolerance to GBV by working with boys and men &lt;br /&gt;o Mobilise a broad cross section of the community at the grassroots level &lt;br /&gt;o Mobilise partnerships among community leaders, government officials and NGOs &lt;br /&gt;o Seek to improve survivors&amp;rsquo; access to services &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One &amp;lsquo;promising initiative&amp;rsquo; listed is the Raising Voices domestic violence project in Uganda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How communication for social and behaviour change programmes can address gender based violence. These should: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o Aim to reduce the acceptability of violence and promote a model of gender equitable norms and behaviours &lt;br /&gt;o Integrate GBV into existing CSBC programmes &lt;br /&gt;o Link communication activities to other types of GBC initiatives &lt;br /&gt;o Seek to improve norms and attitudes among boys and men &lt;br /&gt;o Use multiple media channels to address wide audiences, including young people and men &lt;br /&gt;o Evaluate all CSBC initiatives &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;lsquo;promising initiatives&amp;rsquo; listed here are Puntos de Encuentro in Nicaragua and Soul City in South Africa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are further sections on: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How health service delivery programmes can address gender based violence &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How health policy programmes can address gender based violence &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How youth programmes can address gender based violence. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How humanitarian programmes can address gender based violence &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; How monitoring and evaluation programmes can address gender based violence &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are examples of objectives and indicators for different types of GBV programmes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

The thematic areas are sexual and reproductive health, nutrition, accidents, drug abuse, education, career and employment, and parental responsibilities and social adjustment, adolescent mental health, spirituality and rights for purpose of completeness. The contemporary issues under each of the thematic areas are to be addressed through advocacy and social mobilization, promotion of healthy behaviors through education and skills development, equitable access to quality health services, capacity building, research promotion, participation and young people involvement, and monitoring and evaluation. The strategy has in-built indicators with which programmes can be monitored and evaluated. Review of the framework is five yearly. The results of monitoring and evaluation activities will be used to improve planning and implemention &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of infections on severely malnourished children. The study design used was a descriptive, cross sectional hospital-based study. Results show that there is little difference in the prevalence of severe malnutrition between the two hospitals.55% of all malnourished children were boys. Non-oedematous Protein Energy malnutrition was more prevalent at Muhimbili National Hospital than at Kili District Hospital. More than 75% of all severe Protein Energy Malnutrition patients were below two years of age, 36% of all severe Protein Energy Malnutrition patients admitted also had malaria, 45% of all admitted patients with severe Protein Energy Malnutrition at Kili District Hospital also had diarrhoea. More than 25% of severely malnourished patients died, oedematous type having a higher case fatality rate than non-oedematous one. 86% of the patients who died at MNH had other co-morbidities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In addition to climate change, current demographic trends, economic development and related land use changes have direct impact on increasing demand for freshwater resources. These changes are affecting the vulnerability of water resources. This study reviews the evolution of approaches to vulnerability assessment related to water resources. The aim is to propose a generalised framework for scientifically based vulnerability assessment to support participatory decision-making processes in the field of water resources management, with a specific interest for climate change adaptation. A feasibility study is then presented in the context of the Lower Brahmaputra River Basin (LBRB), Bangladesh. The results show the current main constraints, which include weaknesses in local capacities for water management, lack of institutional coordination, and inefficient monitoring and evaluation. However, vulnerability assessment can play a significant role in identifying adaptation measures. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This World Bank policy research working paper investigates household-level strategies for adapting to climate change in rural settings, looking particularly at the adaptive capacity of poor rural households &amp;ndash; a subject the authors claim has received little attention due to its broad and complex nature. The paper argues that climate change poses two distinct sets of challenges for rural households, which it broadly defines as &amp;lsquo;shocks&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;shifts&amp;rsquo;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;shocks signify events that temporarily disrupt a household's modal environmental conditions, i.e. increased weather variability, and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events; &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;shifts permanently change the modal conditions, i.e. long-term shifts in temperature, rainfall patterns, water availability and other environmental factors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Within this framework, the authors examine evidence from existing empirical literature on topics including: determinants of household economic mobility, ambiguity risk, agricultural technology adoption, reaction to weather-related information, determinants of migration, income diversification, health and past experiences of permanent environmental changes. They synthesise the evidence from this literature into a picture of household-level strategies for adapting to climate change in rural settings. The findings and conclusions include the following examples.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Increased frequency and severity of weather shocks is likely to have the greatest impact among the poorest rural households.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Weather-related declines in schooling in rural areas are often associated with increases in households&amp;rsquo; use of child labour. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Climate shocks and shifts complicate rural households&amp;rsquo; attempts to: smooth consumption (using credit, insurance, savings, etc.), smooth income (adjusting agricultural portfolios, diversifying sources of income, etc.) and evaluate options (such as migration). &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Policies and programmes that help to increase households&amp;rsquo; human capital and improve their access to physical assets, financial capital and markets can play important roles in strengthening their capacity to adapt to climate change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The authors also provide examples of country experiences with better systems of information for adaptation and climate-adapted risk management instruments (such as indexed production insurance) and social safety nets that are targetable and scalable on the basis of weather events. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Drought, the result of regional climatic variability is one of the dominant threats to environment. This study focuses on the biophysical, environmental and health issues concerning drought occurrence in northwest region of Bangladesh. Using both primary and secondary data, the analysis revealed that, during the drought period, rainfall as the dominant factor of supplying surface water and normalizing the dryness of the nature was almost 46% lower than the previous (normal) years. Similarly, average monthly sunshine hours in the drought year was about 7% higher compared to that of the normal year. On an average, groundwater level declined more than one meter compared to the previous years. Thus, many of the tubewells turned dry or failed to supply the required quantity of water for household and irrigation purposes. A significant number of surface water bodies including ponds,ditches, canals and streams had little volume of low quality water. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>According to this study, in Bangladesh, women are more vulnerable than men generally to all kinds of disasters and climate related impacts due to gender inequalities in social, economic and political institutions. Women have limited access to and control over natural resources or money, and more importantly are less mobile and have limited access to information. The study focuses on climate change and gender vulnerability in the context of Khulna region. It finds that most climate change issues, policies and programmes are not gender neutral. Moreover, as the household manager women have to bear the burden of meeting the needs of the family, even when fighting against adversities. The paper highlights several areas which deserve attention, specifically: resource use patterns; gender-specific effects of climate change; patterns of vulnerability; women’s capacity to cope with climate change; gender and decision-making on climate change; and gender aspects of mitigation and adaptation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper argues that the high and volatile food prices that triggered a renewed interest in food security since the 2008–09 crisis are expected to continue due to the impacts of climate change. It notes that current policy is focused on food production; however, a broader approach based on food systems would be more appropriate as it encompasses all aspects of food production, storage, distribution and consumption. As most low-income groups in both rural and urban areas are net buyers of food, access and affordability are central concerns. There is also a need for more attention to urban food security, because more than half of the world’s population now live in urban centres, where there is considerable inequality between wealthier groups and the residents of low-income and informal settlements. The paper concludes that effective policies need to address urban food insecurity in both its income and non-income dimensions, and their impact on gendered disadvantage. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has enormous opportunity and potential in real estate sector and now the rate of growth of real estate sector is high. As real estate businesses are largely contingent on long-term investment, so there must have larger impacts because the consequences of climate change increase over time and the impacts would be huge for Bangladesh as it is likely to be among the countries that are the worst affected by climate change. Study, research or conceptual analysis yet not been conducted in Bangladesh perspective to explore the impact of climate change on real estate sector. So this conceptual analysis is very important to identify the possible impact of climate change on real estate sector in Bangladesh and it will be helpful for investors, developers, policy makers and other stakeholders to adopt relevant measures to adapt and mitigate the impacts for achieving sustainable economy. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study was a prospective observational trial, conducted in 9 sub-Saharan African countries to examine changes in childhood stunting and its determinants after 3years of exposure to an integrated, multi-sector intervention and compared these changes to national trends. Baseline levels of childhood stunting was 20%. 2-year old children from villages were enrolled in the study. Outcome measured included principal determinants of undernutrition and childhood stunting. Three years after the start of the program in 2005-2006, consistent improvements were observed in household food security and diet diversity, and coverage with child care and disease control interventions improved for most outcomes. These findings provide encouraging evidence that a package of multi-sector interventions has the potential to produce reductions in childhood stunting. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The reconstruction of Somalia was envisaged to be built upon a new social contract, which should be negotiated between the superordinate body and the local units of governance. This paper shows that while the founding leaders in north Somalia consulted extensively with the assemblies of elders, creating civilian constitutional orders, military leaders in the south and central regions chose a different approach. The paper presents the following findings: • the economics, demographics and conflicts in the south and centre of Somalia all were such as to make the involvement of elders and other local structures in shaping and legitimating regional governance more difficult • after the UN retreated from its early effort to build decentralised regional governments up into a national federation, communities were left to govern themselves • nevertheless, this gap in local governance was taken up not only by sub-clan and other traditional structures but increasingly by Sharia courts (i.e. radical Islamists) as well • ultimately, various Islamic movements did build on community-level governance and used it to successfully challenge the old warlords • by the time, the warlords realised that their real opponents were the proponents of political Islam, the opportunities to counter were largely lost. Conclusions include: • in a conflict country, the social contract that exists between citizens and their local governance structures not only does not disappear but becomes much more critical to the security of those at the bottom • a primary part of post-conflict reconstruction must be rebuilding the social contract between community governance structures and national ones, and in some circumstances local governance may need to be reformed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Latin American countries have used specific CCT design elements – like amount of cash transfer or particular conditionalities like attending school or health check-ups – to foster investment in children’s development to reduce future poverty. But CCTs’ effectiveness depends on the quality of the programme’s design, and in particular, the synergy between the chosen design and the desired objective. This brief analyses the most important CCT design elements from the Latin American experience - the target population, incentives and conditionalities, and entry and exit rules - to help other countries as they make design decisions to adapt CCTs to their own contexts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The development of international mining projects is one of the most visible consequences of globalisation. But developments in the mining industry are the cause of about 10.3 percent of all displacements in the world. This means that more than a million people per year may be resettled as a result of resource extraction in various parts of the globe. Countries displaying the greatest growth rate of this phenomenon include India, China, Ghana, and many other African counties. The most burning issue is the establishment of large open-pit mines in developing countries, such as the Tarkwa Mine in Ghana, and the Tedi and Porgera Mines in Papua Island. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The impact of mining on the dynamics of internal displacements remains a topic rarely analysed research. Authors are more concerned with displacements induced by the construction of large dams and the creation of national parks or by ongoing urbanisation processes. Instead of contributing to the well-being of local communities, the extraction of resources leads to a growing number of resettlements, environmental destruction, and a deterioration of the situation of marginalised groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consequences of the aforementioned problem do not diverge significantly from other categories of development-induced displacements such as oil-induced displacement, dam-induced displacement, or conservation-induced displacement. The analysis of internal displacement has become the focus of different fields of study. Sociology, social anthropology, human rights and development studies, and even philosophy are amongst disciplines particularly useful in the exploration of the consequences of development induced displacement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research into this category of displacements, now under development for more than 40 years, has prompted the creation of specific theoretical concepts (i.e. the IRR model). The notion of human security also appears to be a useful scientific tool for more in-depth social analyses. Classification included in the Human Development Report published in 1994 distinguishes seven basic aspects of human security: economic security, food security, personal security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security. Extraction of mineral resources leads to substantial threats to each of these aspects. An application of the aforementioned classifications to the research on the consequences of mining-induced displacement and resettlement helps to understand the broader context of problems encountered by the displacees. However, it should also be supplemented by two specific categories: gender security and cultural security. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>It is estimated that developing countries need US$ 531 billion per year additional investment in energy supply and demand technologies, between now and 2050, in order to limit global temperature rise to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. This report looks at the ways in which public climate finance can help meet the investment needs of developing countries by creating conditions for scaled-up investment in low-carbon energy. It contends that developing country governments and custodians of international public finance must deploy limited public finance in ways that leverage an unprecedented volume of private sector investment. Without the appropriate policy, institutional, industry and finance conditions, it will be difficult to achieve the necessary scale of action. With this in mind, the report looks at six case studies before discussing the implications of the findings and drawing recommendations for the Green Climate Fund (GCF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report presents a series of case studies, identifying a number of policy, industry and financial sector conditions that can attract scaled-up public and private investment in low-carbon energy. It includes the following key lessons and insights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Scaled-up investment can be significantly aided through the long-term investment of small amounts of resources; these tactics should be continued beyond scaling-up to address gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The reform of policy and regulatory environment proved crucial to attracting significant scale investment; it is important that such mechanisms are integrated in such a way as to ensure a consistent, coherent and confident investment environment.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Investment in knowledge and knowledge sharing, particularly through international support, can especially strengthen small to medium sized enterprises. Combined with strengthening the capacity of financial institutions, these factors can enhance the attractiveness of even higher risk large-scale investment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The paper proposes a framework to guide governments and international partners in how to provide readiness support to countries with low-carbon energy sectors at different stages of development. Early stage activities include the support of assessing energy options, engaging stakeholders in planning, capacity building and technical support. For more developed sectors, the framework includes activities concerning the design and implementation of regulatory and fiscal instruments and targeted capacity building for national and local government. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The project Akshaya – means perpetuating prosperity- is being implemented in Kerala to address the issues on digital divide in the State in an integrated and holistic way.The project is successfully implemented on a pilot basis in Malappuram. Providing ICT access to all sections of the society even located in the remotest part of the State, development of minimum skill sets to all the people through functional IT Literacy training, creation of relevant local contents to benefit all the interest groups are components of the project. This project is an enabler in generating massive economic growth, creation of direct employment opportunities in the State. The project would have a long-standing impact on the socio-political scenario of the state. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Computer and Internet use, especially in developing countries, has expanded rapidly in recent years. Even in light of this expansion in technology adoption rates, penetration rates differ markedly between developed and developing countries and across developing countries. To identify the determinants of cross-country disparities in personal computer and Internet penetration, both currently and over time, we examine panel data for 161 countries over the 1999-2004 period. We explore the role of a comprehensive set of economic, demographic, infrastructure, institutional and financial factors in contributing to the global digital divide. We find evidence indicating that income, human capital, the youth dependency ratio, telephone density, legal quality and banking sector development are associated with technology penetration rates. Overall, the factors associated with computer and Internet penetration do not differ substantially between developed and developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper assesses the effects of knowledge on economic growth. By using an array of indicators, each of which represents an aspect of knowledge, as independent variables in cross-section regressions that span 92 countries for the period 1960 to 2000, the paper shows that knowledge is a significant determinant of long-term economic growth. In particular, it indicates that the stock of human capital, the level of domestic innovation and technological adaptation, and the level of information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure all exert statistically significant positive effects on long-term economic growth. In terms of innovation, they found that a 20 percent increase in the annual number of USPTO patents granted is associated with an increase of 3.8 percentage points in annual economic growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Twenty one lactating cows were selected from 15 farmers. Six of these animals were kept under traditional farmer practice having dry straw as basal diet and eight of them were kept under an improved diet having UMS as the basal diet. It can be seen that UMS group had significantly higher DM intake, live weight gain and milk yield and had non-significantly lower milk production cost than the control group. However, more such trials with larger number of animals is necessary in reaching any solid conclusion on the effectiveness of the model. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Regional Alliance for the Freedom of Expression and Information (the Alliance), an innovative civil society network, has had a major role in promoting freedom of expression and the right to information regionally. The Alliance coordinates the efforts of 23 civil society organisations (CSOs) from 19 American countries and carries out extensive advocacy work at the regional level. This network’s experience, achievements and lessons learned could be useful to CSOs in Sub-Saharan and South Asian countries aiming to advance freedom of expression and access to information in their own regions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Dissolved arsenic concentrations in the Ganges, Brahmaputra Rivers and confluence of these two rivers show important seasonal variations and maximum arsenic concentrations are observed during the monsoon season (Julyâ€“October). These seasonal variations of dissolved arsenic concentrations were closely related to intense river-water discharge during the monsoon season with high arsenic-rich suspended particulate matter (SPM) loads. These arsenic-rich SPM mainly are primarily originated from erosion of agricultural land in upstream region irrigated with arsenic contaminated shallow groundwater and to some extent weathering of bed rocks. Considerable amount of iron and manganese enriched SPM adsorbs arsenic and increased water temperature in the summer accelerates microbially- mediated reduction of arsenic (V) to more soluble arsenic (III). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Giving Youth a Voice, the first ever nationwide survey on youth, was started in 2011. The main findings of the report were released to the media in mid August, prior to the International Youth Day. The final version, as contained in this report, provides an in-depth understanding of young people's perception and experience of politics and society in Bangladesh. The nationwide survey, with a sample size of 6,575, related to such core policies as education, skill development, labour market, information technology. The survey also explored the role of youth within the state, society, community and family. The IGS team has undertaken a thorough and diligent analysis of the data, and this report presents the findings and analysis. I am confident that this report can positively contribute to the future designing and implementing of youth-related policies in Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>International remittance is an important source of foreign exchange income for the developing countries including Bangladesh. The remittance has become a focal issue in economic literature over two or more decades for its increasing volume and important role in poverty reduction.Global financial crisis started in July 2007, deepened with a collapse in global trade and finance at the end of 2008.Being a global player in the world economy especially in the garments export and wage earners as foreign expatriate, Bangladesh is no exception with this chain reaction. In the miliieu of current global economic slowdown and unprecedented uncertainty,the challenge for the country is to explore domestic market and focuses on some key sectors to robust the growth of the economy.This article presents a brief outline of global financial crisis;its impacts on overseas employment and international remittance inflow of Bangladesh;the government initiatives declared so far to counter the slowdown. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Current e-Governance scenario in healthcare sector in India is disappointing. Public health service run by Government is overburdened and collapsing. Large geographical size, increase population density, lack of transport, inaccessibility, illiteracy, poverty, poor nutritional status, diversity in food habit and life style are various impediments. Government priorities for providing food, safe water and school education is yet to be fulfilled. At this stage low budget for health, lack of funds and coordination have triggered down trend in health services. As medical science is fast developing and information resource is pouring in, there is urgent need for dissemination knowledge by interlinking primary, secondary and tertiary level health centres by ICT applications. This will help health personal to deliver high quality services. From 2006 onwards corporate IT giants are experimenting for ICT application in health sector both in Government and private hospitals. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is meant to stimulate a discussion on how ICT can support the healthcare sector in offering new services and becoming more efficient and effective. ICT has already a major impact on the healthcare sector, but there are more opportunities which need to be explored in order to ensure that affordable, high-quality healthcare will continue to be available to all European citizens. Identifying and using the opportunities which ICT could offer to the healthcare sector will require more research on European level beyond the research projects in EU and national programmes which have already been performed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the last few decades, Latin American (LA) countries have increased oversight of public spending by strengthening Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs), including by implementing social control mechanisms to increasingly involve citizens in monitoring efforts. These reforms help ensure public funds are spent according to the law, on the policies for which they were designated, and in a way that makes a concrete impact. This policy brief analyses the implementation of these reforms in the region, focusing on their design, outcomes, and lessons learned for South Asian and African contexts. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>By the third decade of this century, it is expected that nearly half the population of Bangladesh will live in urban areas. This trend is palpable even now as major urban areas of the country are increasingly becoming hubs of economic, social and cultural activity. This rapid burst of urbanisation requires good urban governance with focus on interdependent principles of sustainability, equity, efficiency, transparency, accountability, security and civic engagement. Rapid urbanisation in Bangladesh has contributed towards transforming the capital Dhaka, a sleepy city back in 1950s into a mega city, which is moving to become one of the most populated cities of the world by 2015. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper argues that ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) provides a flexible, cost-effective and broadly applicable alternative for building robust food systems and reducing the impacts of climate change. Focusing on Africa, the paper highlights actions to better manage ecosystems for food security, including: improve soil management to reduce degradation and erosion; improve agro-biodiversity; develop programs based on the progress of agricultural science and traditional knowledge; and improve capacities of farmers to manage investments and to access new technologies. The paper concludes that sustainable food security strategies must develop new opportunities, increase productivity in agriculture and assist in the development of domestic markets that can withstand international economic volatility. Investment in EbA is one of the most important keys to job creation opportunities that simultaneously contribute to poverty eradication and to sustainable long-term food security. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Gender Quality Action Learning programme initiated a village level intervention in 2007 in 10 districts to increase knowledge, change perception, attitudes, and practice/behaviour of the villagers on discrimination and violence against women. A benchmark survey was conducted before the intervention was initiated. To measure the changes that have taken place due to intervention a midline survey was conducted in 2009-10. The comparison between the surveys show that knowledge, perception and attitudes of the respondents on selected gender issues changed remarkably after the intervention. Results also show that along with increase in
knowledge and changes in perception and attitudes of the respondents on gender roles and relations positively changes in the likelihood of male’s participation in household activity would increase and the incidence of domestic violence against women would decrease. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This article, written by Virginia Vargas, presents a feminist perspective of the World Social Forum (WSF), analysing how changes in feminist strategies are expressed in the organisation's space and processes. The author explains how, as a space of both convergence and conflict between old and new structures of thought, the WSF represents a fascinating and challenging arena for the feminist movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article introduces the WSF as a place of experimentation &amp;ndash; a break from unitary ideological paradigms that, instead, seeks to facilitate a multitude of different strategies and concepts. What links the groups is opposition to neo-liberalism; how and where this struggle is conducted marks where groups differ. It is within this context that feminism often finds itself challenging, as well as engaging with, WSF practice and process, particularly with regard to the harbouring of old patriarchal and exclusionary practices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although women made up 54% of the participants at the first WSF, 85% of those in the most important, 'official' panels were men. Other criticisms include that the WSF runs the risk of becoming an exclusive event only attended by those who can afford it, and that questions surrounding representation in the Organising Committees and the International Committee create tensions in the vision of the WSF as an alternative or revolutionary space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of five WSFs, feminism has made increasing gains in both visibility and recognition, contributing to a consultation-led reform of the WSF structure in 2005, from a largely top-down structure to a broader, bottom-up methodology for organising panels. The aim was to bring different networks together that work on similar issues, allowing for the expression of diverse and plural feminisms. This is vital if the nuance of cultural context is be understood; a crucial component of transitioning from unitary mindsets of universal solutions, to a view of gender as a transversal and cross-cutting dimension within a multitude of other political and cultural struggles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>As countries in Asia and the Pacific recalibrate their growth models to consolidate their positions in the global economy, availability of a highly skilled and technically qualified human resource base will be a crucial determinant of success. This publication compiles valuable contributions to advance thinking and practice related to skills development in the Asian-Pacific region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;education and skills development are crucial to achieving inclusive growth and sustainable green growth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;specifically, countries with a youthful demographic profile need to consider strategies that would improve job prospects for young adults, and technical and vocational education and training (TVET)are key part of such strategies &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;therefore, skills development for employability has been identified as a priority area for educational policy and practice in Asia-Pacific&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;however, a number of countries are yet to ensure adequate harmonisation of skills and training policies with economic and industrial policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;countries need forward-looking skills policies so that appropriate occupational skills are available to fast-growing and emerging sectors of the economy&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;skills training policies need to be augmented with labour market and social protection policies to redress the obstacles to workforce participation, increase employment, and reduce vulnerability of employment &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a conducive regulatory environment is needed for private sector players to occupy a legitimate space for financing and providing skills training&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;industry support is required in the design and delivery of a responsive and diversified skills training program that focuses on applied learning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;specialised strategies for skills training for small and medium enterprises is required to increase employment prospects for workers in the informal sector&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;advocacy and support systems for vulnerable groups to participate in labour markets should be considered &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria infection in pregnancy contributes to low birth weight through intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and preterm delivery (PTD). It was hypothesized that malaria-associated PTD and IUGR have differing etiologies due to timing of infection. In a prospective cohort of primigravid women enrolled at the antenatal clinic of Mangochi District Hospital in Malawi, the associations were investigated between antenatal or delivery parasitemias and IUGR or PTD. Among 178 singleton deliveries, 35% of infants were preterm or had IUGR. Cord blood parasitemia (odds ratio [OR] 5 3.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–8.8], placental parasitemia (OR 5 2.43; 95% CI, 1.2–5.1), and postdelivery maternal peripheral parasitemia (OR 5 2.78; 95% CI, 1.3–6.1) were associated with PTD. Parasitemia and/or clinically diagnosed malaria in the antenatal period was associated with IUGR (OR 5 5.13; 95% CI, 1.4–19.4). Delivery parasitemias had borderline associations with IUGR. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper analyses the establishment and development of the national system of international development assistance in Russia. Covering the period from 2005 to 2010, the paper examines how national priorities for international development assistance were defined, how foreign aid was increased on the threshold of Russia’s G8 Presidency, and how the emerging structure of aid governance evolved. Russia’s participation in multilateral and development cooperation institutions is also considered. The author proposes recommendations for further development of the system of international development assistance in Russia. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This case study from Cameroon's Sudan-Sahel region explores the impact of rainfall on agricultural production and the evidence that supports small-scale farming as a strategy to reduce the vulnerability of crop yields to rainfall variation in the region. Climate data for 20 years and crop production data for six major food crops for the same years are used to identify patterns of correlation. The analysis reveals that the influence of rainfall on agriculture can be diluted by proactive policies that support food production. Proactive policies also reduce the impact of climatic shocks on agricultural production. The findings emphasise the extent of vulnerability of food crop production to rainfall variation among small-holder farmers and reinforce the call for the proactive engagement of relevant institutions and support services in assisting the efforts of small-scale food producers in Africa's Sudan-Sahel. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Following the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva, countries and regions were called upon to develop tools to provide statistical information on the Information Society, with basic indicators and analysis of its dimensions. To that end, several key stakeholders involved in the statistical measurement of the Information Society joined forces in a global ‘Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development’, which was launched in June 2004.

The purpose of this report, “Measuring ICT: the global status of ICT indicators”, is to synthesize the results of the Partnerships’ stocktaking exercise on the status of ICT indicators, carried out in collaboration with the United Nations Regional Commissions, UNCTAD and the OECD. 

The status of official Information Society statistics in developing countries is presented in this report by region, together with two chapters on global issues concerning household and business ICT indicators. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Background Households from vulnerable groups experiencing epidemiological transitions are known to be affected concomitantly by under-nutrition and obesity. Yet, it is unknown to what extent this double burden affects refugee populations dependent on food assistance. We assessed the double burden of malnutrition among Western Sahara refugees living in a protracted emergency. 2005 households were sampled. Anthropometric measurements were collected (weight, height and waist circumference) in 1608 children 6-59 months and 1781 women 15-49 years. The prevalence of GAM in children was 9.1%; 29.1% were stunted, 18.6% were underweight and 2.4% were overweight. Overall, households classified as overweight (31.5%) were most common, followed by undernourished (25.8%), and then double burden affecting 24.7%. The double burden of obesity and undernutrition is highly prevalent in households among western refugees. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>One of the worst characteristics of poverty is its tendency to self-perpetuate, with poor families often being forced to underinvest in their children’s health and education. In Latin America (LA), Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes have been effective in ensuring higher school attendance and greater health services use, both of which are valuable inputs for human capital development and future productivity. However, CCT evaluations have had a harder time identifying effects on health and education impacts. This brief describes how LA countries have used CCTs to improve health and education, the results achieved, and lessons learned for improving health and education in other settings. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This MenCare briefing paper summarises results a report with the same title prepared in 2012 by Promundo for the OAK Foundation. While recognising that girls experience higher rates of sexual violence than boys, the paper seeks to apply a gender lens to boys&amp;rsquo; experiences of sexual violence and exploitation, and raise awareness of the particular challenges boys face. Among the key points presented in the paper are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Sexual exploitation and sexual violence against boys are under recognised and under studied issues, but researchers are increasingly acknowledging the role of gender in sexual abuse and exploitation of boys and men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that 150 million girls and 73 million boys under the age of 18 have experienced sexual violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Notions of masculinity and social expectations of boys and men &amp;ndash; such as being tough and unemotional &amp;ndash; and attitudes surrounding same sex sexual relations, can lead to underreporting from male victims of sexual exploitation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper outlines work done by Promundo in pilot projects in Brazil, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, India, Jamaica, Nepal and South Africa. It features in more detail a case study from the &amp;ldquo;Life Stories of Young Men in Managua&amp;rdquo; project in Nicaragua. It pulls out a number of conclusions from these projects, warning against the &amp;ldquo;ghettoising&amp;rdquo; of sexual violence against boys. This is because boys&amp;rsquo; experiences of violence and violence against women and girls are linked; boys who witness violence as children are more likely to use physical and sexual violence against women and girls later in later life. The paper ends with eight recommendations. These include: pay greater attention to sexual violence against boys within existing SGBV prevention initiatives; make services for sexual violence survivors available to men and boys in ways that are accessible to them; and Integrate work to support boys and men who are survivors of sexual violence in the greater field of engaging men and boys in gender equality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Pacific islands have long been seen as having limited economic potential. This paper explores how the creative economy - based on art, music, film, media, etc. - can be an important element in the broader development agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper figures that across the Pacific, rhetoric of cultural importance is often heard, but rarely seen translated into national development priorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the creative sector in the Pacific islands is largely informal and making a living from a creative or artistic pursuit in the region is not an easy thing to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;prioritising the creative economy is missing in discussions with donors about developmental assistance&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;as a result, the burden of developing and promoting the creative sector mostly rests within the arts community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document indicates that prioritising arts and culture can be a start-point for governments and donors. In this respect, there are opportunities to promote creative economy through tourism and exhibit creative works in metropolitan markets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;developing and maintaining a vibrant arts and culture policy is central to nation building in the Pacific region&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;appropriate commercialisation that assist with both preserving and developing culturally inspired creative pursuits is required&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;still, policy and practice need to protect rights associated with ownership of cultural knowledge, particularly with respect to asserting authenticity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, more and better information is needed on both the supply and demand sides to know what the economic realities are of the creative sector&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;critical policy initiatives include providing infrastructure, financing and investment in the arts and establishing appropriate legislative frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;moreover, developing export markets, encouraging the establishment of creative clusters and setting up mechanisms for effective data collection are also vital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An electronic textbook (e-Textbook) is a digitized (or electronic) form of textbook, which normally needs an endorsement by the national or state government when it is used in the K-12 education system. E-Textbooks have been envisioned to replace existing paper-based textbooks due to its educational advantages. Hence, it is of paramount importance for the relevant parties (i.e. national and state governments, or school districts) to draw a comprehensive roadmap of technologies necessary for the successful adoption of e-Textbooks nationwide. This paper provides a brief overview of e-Textbooks and subsequently an extensive discussion on challenges associated with e-Textbooks in the pursuit of replacing traditional textbooks with e-Textbooks. This paper further provides an extensive review on how the challenges have been approached using existing e-Textbook technologies, such as multi-touch technology, e-Paper, Web 2.0 and cloud computing. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>For planning purposes, it is important to not only determine the economic viability of a development scheme, but also that it produces economic benefits that exceed those that were already being obtained from the pre-existing production systems. This study undertakes these calculations with regards to grazing lands on the banks of the Awash river in north-eastern Ethiopia. These areas were converted into large-scale cotton and sugar plantations in the 1960s. It quantifies the economic benefits generated by three alternative agricultural systems (pastoral livestock production versus cotton and sugar cane estates) and concludes that despite considerable investment by the government, pastoralism is more profitable than either cotton or sugarcane farming while avoiding many of the environmental costs associated with large-scale irrigation projects. The findings suggest that pastoralism is a surer investment in the longer term resilience and economic stability of Ethiopia’s dry lowlands. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is often described as the third revolution in the dissemination of knowledge and in the enhancement of instruction - the first revolution being the invention of written language and the second the development of movable type and books. ICT is a powerful tool which has the potential to transform the educational opportunities and life chances of all students, including those who are normally excluded by virtue of their special circumstances and special educational needs. ICT can break down some of the barriers that lead to underachievement, student disaffection and educational exclusion. If used appropriately it can also improve the quality and consistency of instruction by providing an enabling environment for both students and teachers to access information and resources. However, technology must be the ‘servant of educational practice and not its master’. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper compares the vulnerabilities to climate change and climate variability of the indigenous people with the Bengali population of Bangladesh. It distinguishes between (a) individual vulnerabilities that are related to an individual’s capability to adapt to climate change and; (b) spatial vulnerabilities, that is, vulnerabilities that are related to the location of a person (like the exposure to climate change-induced disasters). While an individual’s capability to adapt to climate change is determined by many factors, some relatively simple approximation is to look at poverty, landlessness, and illiteracy. Spatial vulnerabilities are reviewed by looking at drought hazard maps, flood hazard maps, landslide hazard maps, and cyclone hazard maps. Hence, the paper compares levels of poverty, landlessness, illiteracy, and the more direct though also more subjective exposures to increased droughts, floods, landslides, and cyclones across the two population groups. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>India launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in 2009 to create policy conditions to make solar power as affordable as conventional power by 2022 and establish the country as global leader in solar energy. The aim is to achieve grid parity (electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid) by 2020, by fostering the installation of 20 GW of solar installations. Achieving this target would establish India as a global leader in solar power generation. This ‘Inside story on climate compatible development’ by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network provides an overview of the initiative, including key lessons and implications. The brief highlights that efforts to streamline projects should not undermine environmental protection, nor the community engagement and flexible systems required for rural electrification. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) developments have taken place in Africa with the significant growth over the past decade. This paper looks at the evidence on the role of emerging ICTs in the agricultural sector in Africa with lessons from Asia with respect to farmers’ access to information and other services that would help improve agricultural productivity, practices, and farmer livelihoods. It suggests that countries should avoid monopoly situations and encourage pluralistic providers to induce competition for higher efficiency and lower costs to consumers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper intends to impart two pragmatic ways of utilizing ICT in disaster governance. First is facilitating cooperation among the different government agencies through a web-based Disaster Coordination System to address disaster management. A comprehensive workflow facility that permits remote exchange of data and transactions among regional centers, local municipalities and the national disaster coordinating council is the major feature of the system. Second is applying concepts of human resources but at the same time addressing the peculiarities of a volunteer in the design of a volunteer management system for the Philippine National Red Cross. The system utilizes web and mobile technologies. Both systems are perceived to be proactive and dependable references for policy-making. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A field experiment was conducted at the Agroforestry Farm, Department of Agroforestry, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Dinajpur to evaluate the performance of cabbage under two multipurpose trees i.e. Black sins (Albezia lebbeck) and mango (Mangifera indica). There was also a control plot (open field). Local variety of cabbage was used as test crop. The experiment was laid out in RCBD with three replications. It was recorded that in partial shade condition the higher yield of cabbage would produced (28.33 t/ha) was recorded in mango field than black sins. Significantly the lowest yield potential under black series and the values was 18.50 t/ha cabbage, respectively. The study revealed that cabbage can be produced under 4 year's old mango tree without significant yield loss as compared to open field. The black sins created approximately 55-60 % shade that was not found suitable for cabbage. Hence, it can be advocated that production of cabbage with early aged (u &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Drawing primarily from original data collected from more than 100 semi-structured research interviews, this study discusses the benefits of four climate change adaptation projects being implemented in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia and the Maldives. The article describes ongoing adaptation efforts in each of these four countries and finds that projects enhance infrastructural resilience by building relevant, robust and flexible technologies. They build institutional resilience by creating strong, permanent, legitimate organisations in place to respond to climate change issues. They also promote community resilience by enhancing local ownership, building capacity and creating networks that help people learn and adapt to climate change. The study shows that all four of case studies couple adaptive improvements in technology and infrastructure with those in governance and community welfare, underscoring the holistic or systemic aspect of resilience. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This article discusses the Roles of ICT in education. Information communication technologies (ICT) at present are influencing every aspect of human life. They are playing salient roles in work places, business, education, and entertainment. Moreover, many people recognize ICTs as catalysts for change; change in working conditions, handling and exchanging information, teaching methods, learning approaches, scientific research, and in accessing information. Therefore, this review article discusses the roles of ICTs, the promises, limitations and key challenges of integration to education systems. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Governments and public sector organizations around the world are facing to reform their public administration organizations and deliver more efficient and cost effective services, as well as better information and knowledge to their stakeholders. E-governance is the effective use of Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) to improve the system of governance that is in place, and thus provide better services to the Citizens. e-Governance is considered as a high priority agenda in India, as it is considered to be the only means of taking IT to the “Common Public”. Developments in e-Governance
provide opportunities to harness the power of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to make the business of governance inexpensive, qualitatively responsive, and truly encompassing. In this paper we discuss about the basic problems and acceptability of e-Governance in India. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>BRAC initiated an innovative programme known as Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) in 2002 to address the extreme poverty in Bangladesh. Impact assessment studies on the
first phase of CFPR (2002-06) have shown that the programme had significant positive impacts on the livelihoods of the participant households. However, whether this impact on livelihoods is
sustainable or not remained the key research question. Based on panel data from three rounds of survey (2002, 2005 and 2008), this study explores sustainability of livelihood impacts of the first
phase of CFPR. The findings show that programme impacts on income, employment, food security and asset holding were mostly sustainable in the long-run. Magnitude of impact on per capita income was found to be increased over time. Livestock and poultry holding increased substantially among the programme participants due to mainly transfer of these assets by the programme and the increase sustained in the long-run. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study presents the summary of an anthropometric and retrospective mortality survey conducted in eight states of Northern Nigeria from 6th February to 9th March, 2012. The main objectives were to determine the nutritional status of children under five years of age, and women of reproductive age group, to assess infant and young child feeding practices and to estimate crude and under-five mortality rates. In total, 7,186 children under five years of age, 6,098 women were interviewed from 4,733 households from a total of 239 clusters.
Ten cases of bilateral edema were found in seven of the eight surveyed state, there was no case of marasmic kwashiorkor. (children with Severe Acute Malnutrition and bilateral edema). The highest and lowest prevalence of GAM were found in Yobe and Zamfara states at 15.4% (11.6-18.195 CI) and 6.4% (4.8-8.4 95% CI) respectively. The prevalence of severe acute malnutrition ranged from 0.6% in Katsina to 3.1% in Yobe states. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>CT is the study of developing and using technology to process information and aid communication. E-health refers to health
services and information delivered or enhanced through the use of ICT. The new challenge is to improve health care
services locally, regionally, and worldwide by using the services that ICT provides. Here, an overview of the existing policies will be described, thereafter different existing projects in the SAARC and ASEAN regions will be described. With the
help of user analysis, the proposed model will then be described. Finally, the justification of the proposed model will
be done from various points of view. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper argues that successful adaptation of agriculture to ongoing climate changes would help to maintain productivity growth and reduce pressure to bring new lands into agriculture. It explores the potential co-benefits of adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use, SIMPLE, is utilised to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates and land use emissions. The study finds that although investing in the least developed areas may be a desirable objective for adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant. Overall, broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are relatively inexpensive compared to many mitigation activities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Distance Education for Teacher Training: Modes, Models, and Methods gathers research and lessons learned from numerous distance education programs in over 100 nations and territories to help distance education policymakers, planners and designers develop distance education systems focused on producing high-quality teachers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether upgrading &amp;ldquo;un-trained&amp;rdquo; teachers&amp;rsquo; existing skills, providing teachers with enrichment or continuing education opportunities or helping teachers gain advanced degrees or certification, nations across the globe are increasingly turning to distance education as a convenient, flexible and multimodal avenue for teacher education&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance Education for Teacher Training focuses on the following areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;    modes of distance education&amp;mdash;types of distance-based delivery systems and their strengths and weaknesses from print to digital gaming to online learning to mobile technologies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;    models of distance education for teacher training programs&amp;mdash;actual examples of various programs from each continent&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;    methods or best practices necessary to develop a high-quality distance education program Unlike most distance education books, this guide focuses less on policy and funding, and almost exclusively on building high-quality teaching and learning within a distance-based system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With over 200 web references to existing programs and technology tools; an annotated reference section of distance-based resources; and an extensive glossary of terms and bibliography, this guide is a valuable resource for those interested in not just distance education but technology and professional development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The South African population faces many of the global concerns relating to micronutrient deficiency and the impact this has on health and well-being. Moreover, there is a high prevalence of HIV infection, compounded by a high level of co-infection with Tuberculosis. This pilot study evaluates the impact of a fortified supplementary food on the health and well-being of a cohort of cr&amp;egrave;che children, aged 3 to 6, and adult TB patients drawn from the Presidential Node of Alexandra, Johannesburg, South Africa. A further aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and validity of non-invasive indicators of nutritional status in a field-based population sample. The investigational product - e'Pap is supported by anecdotal evidence that whole grain cereals with food-style nutrients constitute an effective supplementary food for those suffering from effects of food insecurity, poor health and well-being and coping with tuberculosis and HIV infection. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladeshi ministries and non-governmental organisations have been implementing a number of local level adaptation (LLA) projects in response to the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategies and Action Plan (BCCSAP). This report notes that there is a need in Bangladesh for updated information and knowledge on climate change trends, risks and vulnerability of human and ecological systems, adaptation options and technologies, as well as planning, implementation and evaluation of LLA. Focusing on two case studies from Bangladesh, one in a coastal area and the other in a drought-prone area, this research aims to better understand how the local conditions and external factors determine the effectiveness of local level adaptation initiatives. The case studies mainly employed qualitative methods and participatory reflections of project staff and communities collected through focus group discussion and key informant interviews. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

It is however important to emphasis that the paper is not about evaluating the performance and the progress made by African countries towards the realization of the set of targets of the MDGs but rather on examining a possible link between the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society of African countries and the achievement of these development goals – the MDGs. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This advocacy report claims that the fight against HIV has reached a tipping point. Five priority points must be addressed to carry this through: 1) End confusion about “combination prevention” 2) Narrow the gaps in the treatment cascade 3) Prepare for new non-surgical male circumcision devices 4) Define and launch a core package of PrEP demonstration projects 5) Safeguard HIV prevention research funding. The report, which is abundantly illustrated with graphs and tables, concludes with a call for amplified global and national leadership. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This new Broadband Strategies Handbook is intended as a next-generation tool for policy makers, regulators, and other relevant stakeholders as they address issues related to broadband development. It aims to help readers, particularly those in developing countries, by identifying issues and challenges in broadband development, analyzing potential solutions to consider, and providing practical examples from countries that have addressed broadband-related matters. It goes beyond the regulatory issues and looks more broadly at the challenges of promoting and universalizing broadband access. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades few countries have experienced a more protracted emergency than Somalia. Absence of a functioning central government and the ongoing conflict have led to a lack of access to basic social services, resulting in the country falling amongst the highest child and maternal mortality rates in the world. This learning paper by the Regional Emergency Cluster Advisor (RECA) project captures the experience of the Somalia WASH Cluster and draws lessons on how an effective knowledge management system can be developed and implemented. The paper aims to provide an example framework of a successful knowledge management system that can be adapted by other national WASH Clusters to support a predictable, effective, timely and coherent WASH emergency preparedness and response. The paper concludes that practical knowledge management provides information, support and clarity to field level WASH practitioners, and enhances the impact and effectiveness of humanitarian response. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change creates additional threats to existing health problems in developing countries. Among the most likely health problems due to climate change are increased incidences of water and vector-borne diseases due to more frequent flooding and higher temperature in such countries. A wide literature exist that documents and discusses the effects of climate change on health. This working paper reviews the literature on climate change and health with a particular focus on identifying the literature that discusses the governance aspects in linking climate change adaptation and mitigation to health in urban areas in developing countries. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This 121-page publication, published by the Good Governance Learning Network (GGLN), comprises a collection of essays intended to explore alternative conceptions, approaches, and methods for shaping a vibrant, pro-poor system of local governance and democracy in South Africa. It was published to highlight what the authors deem to be innovative approaches, and ultimately argues that participatory governance needs to be substantive, both in terms of process and with respect to outcomes, thus the key call of the publication is to 'put participation at the heart of development/put development at the heart of participation.' &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this paper is to document this experiment of the British Raj with female education that has not previously been examined. The Committeeâ€™s ideas and activities and the bureaucracyâ€™s reaction to those ideas form crucially important documents for charting the course of female education in the early 20th century. These invaluable documents in the holdings of the National Archives of Bangladesh have so far escaped the notice of scholars. The paper also investigates the rhetoric of intention and implementation in the face of political reality in the case of the short-lived province of Eastern Bengal and Assam (1905-1911). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>A study of two large scale â€˜ICTs in School Educationâ€™ programs of two neighboring states of India brings out some interesting insights. The integrated model followed in Kerala stateâ€™s IT@Schools program, where the accent is on developing systemic in-house capabilities anchored around the role of school teachers, has shown considerable success. The alternative model of â€˜outsourcingâ€™ or â€˜BOOTâ€™ employed by the Mahiti Sindhu program in the state of Karnataka, where private vendors were paid to run the program, does not show such positive outcomes. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Bangladesh has made substantial progress since the 1970s in expanding the coverage of maternal healthcare services, yet maternal mortality remains high, as available but limited data suggest. In this respect, to fill the gap need for updated and reliable data on costs and efficiency of government maternal healthcare services in Bangladesh, a special survey was conducted in 2011, and the current report is built upon the findings of that survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn conclusions are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the government in Bangladesh is a major provider of healthcare services, particularly through the sub-district and district hospitals, as well as college hospitals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;however, further improvement in maternal health and in overall health outcomes is needed, which requires that the government increase access to services&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this framework, further expansion in the delivery infrastructure is necessary, as most facilities are operating at optimal or above-optimal levels of utilisation, with the system as a whole evidencing problems of undersupply &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;still, substantial increases in service coverage can be gained through future efficiency gains, even if it does not substantially increase government health expenditures as a share of national income &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;nevertheless, a mix of more budgetary funding and further efficiency gains would be the more optimal outcome&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;equally important, a routinely track of the efficiency and costs of government healthcare delivery is very recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This document is an evaluation summary of the project &amp;lsquo;changing gender norms among young men and reducing violence&amp;rsquo; which was run in Chongqing, China by PATH, in partnership with the China Family Planning Association and the Nike Foundation. The objective of the project was to critically examine gender related attitudes and norms in order to reduce harmful behaviours such as sexual harassment and partner violence. The project was implemented in factories and vocational schools and its target audience was male workers and students between the age of 15 and 24. The project took a similar approach to Program H and Men as Partners (MAP). Life skills training was developed by PATH, as well as a facilitator manual (PATH 2010). Participants went to eight education sessions over a period of six months and received a &amp;lsquo;Real Man, Confident Man&amp;rsquo; award for completion. The evaluation of the project used a version of the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) scale, which was adapted for the Chinese context. The key findings of the evaluation were: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; The majority of participants felt the project was useful (92% of students and 98% of workers) and that participation led to a change in their opinions and behaviour (82% and 68%). &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Gender related attitudes as measured by the GEM scale improved significantly when baseline and end line survey responses were compared. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Some violent or harassing behaviour improved (according to self reported incidents of partner violence). &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Female colleagues reported that they had noticed changes in the male participants, in terms of losing their temper less quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study presents the summary of a cross-sectional anthropometric and mortality survey undertaken in eight states in northern Nigeria from 10th to 25th of December, 2010. The survey was conducted in Borno, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara states from 3,325 households and 4,814 children under five years of age. The objective was to determine malnutrition prevalence.
The prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) was found to be highest in Sokoto and Borno states at 12.6% and 5.1% respectively. Four out of the eight states reported GAM above 10%, with the upper confidence limit for all states except Borno above 10%. 21 cases of bilateral oedema were reported in the total sample. There was no case of marasmus and kwashiorkor (children with severe acute malnutrition and bilateral edema. 
Underweight was highest and lowest in Katsina and Borno at 44.9% and 24.9% respectively. Stunting was found to be generally above 50% &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Climate change adaptation responses of male and female farmers are influenced by various factors. This study utilised a combination of descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis to study the factors that influence the decision to adapt to a given climate change scenario. Using cross-sectional data collected from 136 households in eastern Uganda, the study undertook the analysis at two levels: a pooled sample analysis and a gender disaggregated analysis. Contrary to other empirical studies, the study found that the factors influencing climate change adaptation decisions vary considerably between men and women. The adaptation decisions of female heads depended on and were sensitive to more covariates compared to the decisions of male heads of household. Furthermore, climate change adaptation decisions of female heads were influenced by more liquid household assets, while those of male heads were influenced by real estate, especially land. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>ICTs are changing all the spheres of human lives. Hence, it is a popular belief that, agricultural extension also no exception to this. It is also expected that the ICT led extension systems are going to act as a key agent for changing agrarian situation and farmers’ lives by improving access to information and sharing knowledge. Hence, renewed enthusiasm to use new ICTs for agricultural advisory services led to mushrooming of e-initiative pilots in India. Development practitioners are experimenting innovative ICT initiatives exclusively for agricultural information and knowledge delivery. Unlike other sectors, agriculture is a complex, more so agricultural extension, hence, there are some projects shown the way forward and continue to grow and most other projects are floundering after few years of operation. Large number of projects stuck as pilots only and very few continuously innovated, replicated and sustained over the years. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>During the past twenty years, multi-actor dialogues have played an important part in the consolidation of democratic processes in Latin America and in increasing the participation of organised sectors of civil society in defining and overseeing public policies. To explore how these dialogues have worked in Latin America, this Brief focuses on three emblematic multi-actor dialogues from Argentina, Peru and Mexico, that are representative of the variety of political systems present in the region. It highlights the methodological and contextual factors that influenced their success and identifies best practices that have the potential to be replicated in other regions of the world. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

The program’s goal is to build teacher capacity for mainstreaming ICTs in education, and to support the development of teachers as change agents in the education system as it faces the pressures and demands of the 21st century. The program recognizes that teachers are a vital link in the education chain, and for education to truly respond to the needs of 21st century, they must play a central role in leveraging technology, and in particular, using new and old Information
and Communication Technology (ICTs) devices in teaching and learning. How prepared are the teachers in Sub‐Saharan Africa classrooms to deliver 21st century education? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The understanding of the implications of climate change has broadened in recent years, covering a complex web of development and security issues. In the meanwhile, Pacific island countries remain on the frontline, vulnerable not only to rising seas but also the global responses to the emerging climate security threats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;climate change amplifies many of the Pacific existing development challenges beyond the obvious environmental concerns - addressing climate change is about securing Pacific future&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;migration, both internally and externally, is likely to be the biggest consequence of climate change in the Pacific region &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in this context, the movement of people from coastal homelands to urban centers because of climate-induced impacts will put increasing pressure on already over-taxed physical and social infrastructure &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ongoing geopolitical competition in the Pacific will also play into climate change security scenarios, particularly as aid and resettlement programs may be used as leverage to gain influence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The author notes that the prevailing adaptation approach in the Pacific islands doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet the threat of climate change to these islands. However, factoring in a holistic approach to climate change to the post-Millennium Development Agendas has the potential to bring real benefits for Pacific islands security and wellbeing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations include: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investing in education, health care and poverty alleviation measures is encouraged to be seen through the lens of climate change adaptation &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific leaders should be more pointed in their criticism of major industrial powers who continue to feed the problem of carbon emissions regardless of its impact on the rest of the world &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pacific islands should move away from the rhetoric of vulnerability to emphasise the value they offer to the world (e.g. they have 60% of global tuna stocks)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;climate changes implications should be adequately discussed when formulating the new global development goals &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Knowledge management has been hailed as one of the most important developments in the fields of information studies and management science in the recent decades. By capturing,
organizing, documenting and sharing organisational knowledge, Knowledge management helps today’s complex organisations to make better decisions and solve their problems effectively. As highest centers of learning, universities need to build information infrastructure and create a favourable atmosphere where teaching and non-teaching staff, students, researchers, patrons and other stakeholders can take part in various knowledge management
activities. The role of knowledge workers in this regard is quite important. By advocating knowledge discovery and use, knowledge workers can bring about changes in the university’s organisational cultures and individual behaviors relative to knowledge. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Liver biopsy is an established procedure to diagnose disease, to assess prognosis and to follow up of liver diseases.Although liver biopsy is a confirmatory diagnostic procedure of majority of the hepatological disorders, it carries the risk of complications. Though major complications rarely occur, minor complications are common. To minimize complications, several biopsy techniques have been developed. The present study was intended to correlate the clinical diagnoses with histological diagnoses and to observe the complications encountered by the children with percutaneous liver biopsy procedure. Liver biopsy is a well established procedure in the diagnosis and follow up of liver diseases. But it is not without risk of complications. So, before deciding for a liver biopsy, the indications and risks must be assessed cautiously for each patient. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>ELT curriculum design has seen several transformations overtime, especially with the changing views on the educational ideologies and philosophies in the western world. As far as teaching English in an English as a Second/Foreign language (ESL/EFL) context is concerned, it is often suggested that the ESL or the EFL education should be acculturalized as to be responsive to a particular group of people, and that again refers to the need for a national curriculum for ELT in an EFL country. Thus, in designing an ELT curriculum in an ESOLi context, the designers need to examine not only whether the curriculum is responsive to the needs of a group of learners but also if it is â€˜culturally appropriateâ€™ in that context or not. Following a qualitative case study research method, this paper examines the extent to which the Higher Secondary ELT national curriculum in Bangladesh is responsive to the socio-cultural needs and the needs of the learners. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents the main results of Chile in the SITES2006 study regarding the presence of traditional and innovative pedagogical practices with and without ICT in schools, and analyses to what extent factors affecting the implementation of these practices that were found in the international study (i.e. infrastructure, technical and pedagogical support and ICT-related vision) are affecting –or not- the national results. Based on this, the paper also reviews to what extent Enlaces, the Chilean ICT in Education policy implemented since the last decade, has contributed to sustain these results. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper reports on research undertaken in Nepal into perceptions of trust in public eprocurement systems and of their anti-corruption capabilities. The research set out to examine the relationships between factors including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, and intent to adopt anti-corruption technology in public procurement. The research was guided by the Technology Acceptance model and Principal-agent theory. The findings suggest that the intent-to-adopt public e-procurement has a positive and significant relationship with concepts of usefulness, ease of use, and trust when democratic governments in developing countries attempt to combat corruption in public procurement. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Swedish Embassy in Maputo and the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) have decided that there is a need to assess the impact of development and poverty reduction policies ‘from below’, and to regularly consult local populations in order to understand local processes and relationships. A series of five “Reality Checks” will take place in the period 2011-2016, focussing on the dynamics of poverty and well-being with a particular focus on good governance, agriculture/climate and energy that are key sectors in Swedish development cooperation with Mozambique. Each Reality Check will be published in the form of one Main Report and three Sub-Reports from each of the three selected study-sites. This is the first Sub-Report on the District of Cuamba. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This brief explores the different types of market-based climate mitigation policies being implemented across five different emerging economies: China, India, Brazil, South Africa and South Korea. Market-based policies work through raising the costs of emitting greenhouse gases and/or reducing the costs of producing or consuming lower emitting alternatives. In adjusting incentives, these policies are designed to change the behaviour of companies and individuals so that supply and demand can be directed toward low emission strategies. Each of the countries have pledged to reduce emissions, though methods of measurement (China and India measure emissions per unit of GDP, while the rest measure against predicted business-as-usual levels) and scope of target varies (spanning between 30 to 45 per cent by 2020).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Findings include a number of commonalities, including a preference for incentives, such as removing financial barriers to mitigation actions, over disincentives such as higher taxes and restricted lending. There is also a clear preference for investing in renewable energy, for a number of interlocking reasons: climate change mitigation, diversifying energy production, energy security, improving health, meeting increasing demand, reducing pollution, etc. The brief notes that significant groundwork and monitoring is required for the implementation of these complex policies, which are prone to evolution (this is especially true of trading strategies, such as cap-and-trade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brief reports on each of the countries in depth. Some of the policies highlighted include the following.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Brazil: preferential financing for ethanol-based electricity production and guaranteed tariffs for electricity from renewable sources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;China: regional cap-and-trade is currently in pilot stage, with the aim of achieving a national, unified energy system around 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;India: the Perform, Achieve and Trade scheme, which covers eight energy-intensive areas and uses carbon trading, mandatory reduction targets and penalties to reduce emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;South Africa: a range carbon taxes, rising over time, aimed at emissions, goods and energy production.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;South Korea: long-running and significant subsidies for renewable energy and the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Many female sex workers in Bangladesh get pregnant willingly or even unknowingly but face dire situation raising the child. Children of the female sex workers in Bangladesh are at risk of many significant threats to their health and wellbeing. While some of these problems are shared with other children of similar social and economic circumstances in Bangladesh, children of sex workers experience a range of problems due to the social stigma and threats associated with their mother’s sex work and the resulting discrimination. Very limited studies have been under taken to bring to light the life of these children. The current study tries to depict the life of the street based sex workers’ children in Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper focuses on the success stories of Indian Teacher Education Institutions in ICT application, integration and use for and in the teacher training programmes, on issues and challenges associated with use of ICT in enhancing teacher quality and enabling and enhancing the ICT use in the associated schools. It also attempts to put forward the new opportunities and benefits to the system. This paper also attempts to look at the efforts put in by Government of India, the corporate interventions and the institutional efforts in Integrating ICT in teacher education with an aim to bring a transformation in teaching learning and improving teacher quality. To some extent attempt has also been made to look at the challenges the institutions and the Governments may come across in implementing and integrating the ICT at various stages of teacher preparation and the perceived threats. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a retinal vascular disorder of preterm neonates resulting in visual impairement. Along with prematurity, very low birth weight and hyperoxia, role of blood transfusions in the occurrence of ROP has been strongly emphasized.This was a prospective observational study. It was done among the premature (&lt;34 weeks) VLBW neonates admitted to SCABU and ICU of Dhaka Shishu Hospital.This study showed that repeated blood transfusion resulting in large cumulative volume, transfusion in first week of life has significant association with ROP. Other risk factors are very low birth weight, prolonged oxygen inhalation and mechanical ventilation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Asia&amp;rsquo;s most advanced economies are today tremendously &amp;ldquo;services economies&amp;rdquo;. This paper aims to help understanding the potentials of investments in Asian service sectors, especially in terms of job creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper finds that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sectors are found to receive considerably larger amounts of foreign investment, when compared with other sectors &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;greenfield transactions (development of developmentally untouched lands) are found to be by far the most important mode of investments into the region&amp;rsquo;s service sectors &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;healthcare, telecommunications, financial services, food-related stores and business services are found to be the sectors where &amp;ldquo;mergers and acquisitions&amp;rdquo; are most prevalent &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;on the other hand, the presence of sizable intra-regional &amp;ldquo;upward flowing&amp;rdquo; service sector investments is verified, especially from China, and particularly into Hong Kong &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Policy implications are that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is clear that whatever trade and investment restrictions might exist in Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sectors, transactional investment inflows will not be preventable from surpassing those, going into the local manufacturing sectors &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;accordingly, Asian policymakers should be aware that very significant foreign investor interest in entering these sectors from inside and outside the region is present&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;that is, future moves to liberalise Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sectors will correspondingly be met with an overwhelming investor response &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;it is inevident that &amp;ldquo;poorer countries can open up for foreign investments only when they reach a certain threshold level of economic development&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there is no reason to assume that more foreign investment into the region&amp;rsquo;s service sectors will not have a significant positive impact on regional job creation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The document concludes that today, the need for regional leaders to implement economic reforms and policies to secure rapid expansion of and job creation in the service sectors is greater than ever. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This outcome statement is from the women&amp;rsquo;s and civil society networks and organisations present at the regional dialogue on sustainable development and the post-2015 development agenda in November 2012, Bangkok. The statement argues that while UN agencies have affirmed that the principles of human rights, equality and sustainability should guide discussions on post-2015, it will not be possible to do this without also considering crises around food, climate, finance and fuel and their position within the development model. The paper gives some background on the key gender issues within the Asia-Pacific region, drawing attention to the significant challenges around poverty, inequality, insecurity and violence that must be tackled by the post-2015 agenda. The statement is then divided into four sections: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Women workers&amp;rsquo; rights &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Women in conflict and transition to peace &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Sexual and reproductive health and rights &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Women&amp;rsquo;s political agency &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each section outlines some of the key problems experienced in the Asia-Pacific region and makes recommendations on how a post-2015 development framework should begin to tackle these problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This issue of Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) highlights how young Africans are driving change by challenging the norms and structures that exclude them, engaging with the state, and demanding accountability. PLA is an ongoing series sharing field experiences, conceptual reflections, and methodological innovations in participatory learning. This issue comprises contributions from practitioners across Africa, and is intended to demonstrate the persistence, passion and enthusiasm that youth bring to governance processes, driving change in creative and unexpected ways. It highlights how young Africans are addressing the documentation gap that surrounds youth and governance in Africa and enabling other participatory practitioners – young and old – to learn from their experiences. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>By the end of 2007, 3.3bn people, half the world’s human population, were using mobile phones. In Africa, where fixed telephone line coverage is still weak, mobile phone technology has provided a long-awaited solution to communications isolation. The author of this paper provides background to China’s major investment in African telecommunications, focusing specifically on foreign investment in telecommunications infrastructure in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and on the two Chinese companies most significantly involved in the DRC telecommunications sector: ZTE and Huawei. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Malaria is a major public health threat to the African continent. Rainfall and temperature are two of the major factors triggering malaria epidemics in warm semi-arid and high altitude epidemic risk areas. The ability of the mosquitoes to transmit Plasmodium spp. is dependent upon a series of biological features generally referred to as vectorial capacity. In this study, the vectorial capacity model (VCAP) has been expanded to include the influence of rainfall and temperature variables on malaria transmission potential. Data from two remote sensing products were used to monitor rainfall and temperature and were integrated into the model, which was tested in Eritrea and Madagascar. The analysis shows that the expanded VCAP correctly tracks the risk of malaria both in regions where rainfall and/or temperature is the limiting factor. The VCAP maps could be used as a resource for testing malaria early warning applications in epidemic prone regions of sub-Saharan Africa. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Inside this report, you will find a snapshot summary of the top 10 key policy developments over the past year that relate to the HIV response among gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) worldwide. Ranked by the Global Forum on MSM &amp;amp; HIV (MSMGF), the list includes both successes and setbacks in the global effort to achieve Universal Access for all. Taking stock of these developments is essential for evolving our response to the HIV epidemic among MSM, strengthening community mobilization efforts on the ground, and sharpening our global advocacy efforts. The list also includes events that were not direct policy developments in and of themselves but carry significant policy implications. This page summarizes the developments contained in the report. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Sub-Saharan Africa is home to some of the most nutritionally insecure people in the world. Poor infrastructure and limited resources compounded with conflict, HIV, and poor access to health services are factors that contribute to the staggering levels of malnutrition and food insecurity on the continent. Despite these enormous challenges, some countries in Africa are making progress towards food and nutrition security and there has never been a better time to work towards improved human development that has nutrition as a goal. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The paper reviews evidence of the economic impacts of green infrastructure in fragile states. Upfront construction costs for GI were up to 8% higher than non-green infrastructure projects. Climate Finance was not adequately captured by Fragile states for GI investments, and governance issues may further hinder capability to take full advantage. GI Investments needed strong government participation as well as institutional capacities and capabilities that fragile states may not possess. Potential poverty reduction includes improved agricultural yields and higher rural electrification rates, benefits that can be transmitted to other sectors of the economy not directly linked to the GI investment. Whilst there are examples of GI investments creating new jobs in a number of sectors, it is unclear what the employment opportunities advantages are in respect to traditional infrastructure investments. The correct market conditions (i.e. labour regulations or energy demand) are also required in order to maximise employment creation opportunities. Such factors that may not be fully exploited by fragile state governments lacking the capacity to do so. GI investments have a number of co-benefits including increased energy security and improved health outcomes, whilst a potential reduction of a country’s vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change being arguably the most important co-benefit for such investments in a fragile state context. Lastly, they found there is some evidence that GI options are taken into consideration during project appraisal. Engagement mostly occurs in projects specifically designed with green goals, hence there is no data showing decision making that lead to a shift towards any green alternative. Comparisons of costs, co-benefits, poverty reduction benefits or employment creation benefits between the two typologies are also not evident. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This white paper was commissioned at the request of The Global Alliance for Information and Communication Technologies and Development (UNGAID), a United Nations (UN) body launched in 2006, which remains at the forefront of highlighting the relevance of ICT for development. The network emerged out of the 2005 UN Summit emphasizing ICT involvement for development goals with a special focus on the MDGs. UNGAID serves as a global forum addressing issues closely tied to ICT diffusion, relevancy, and implications in development. UNGAIDs mission stresses the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach, following the belief that a people-centered and knowledge-based information society is essential for achieving better life for all. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>On the way to reduce fertility rate of Bangladesh, mass media plays significant role to raise consciousness about the family planning program on general peoples. In this study the impact of mass media has been measured by the pattern of watching television, listening radio and reading newspaper. Using the proportional hazards model, the mass media exposure found to be a significant differential of fertility even after controlling the effects of contraception, place of residence, and motherâ€™s educational and employment status. This implies, by taking necessary steps, mass media can be used much more adequately to reduce fertility rate of Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is written to serve as a basis for discussing the role of government: as an enabler, regulator, and provider of ICT based services in the Asian Forum on Information Communication and Technology Policy and e-Strategies being held at Kuala Lumpur from 20-22 October, 2003. The paper presents developments in the area of e-government in Asian countries. It discusses the kind of applications that have been developed, benefits that have been delivered, and the reasons why many developing countries in the world have been quick in adopting e-government. To exploit the full potential of e-government there are many challenges. Several factors that are necessary for building effective e-government applications are identified on the basis of an analysis of success and failures of e-government applications that have
been developed so far. In the final section, the paper defines a role for governments in Asia that can enable them to exploit the full potential of e-government. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Syrian grassroots civilian opposition has been the primary engine of the popular uprising against the regime of Bashar Assad. Local arrangements for self-organization have evolved from so-called local coordination committees (LCCs), which are mainly involved in media work and the organization of protests. They have created sophisti- cated structures of civilian administration in the liberated areas of Syria. Currently, the protracted violence, sectarianism, radicalization, lack of coordination among rebel forces and deteriorating social conditions are putting the survival of these LCCs and local opposition councils in serious jeopardy. The achievements in bottom-up mobili- zation and organization, as well as the inclusiveness of these new organizations, could be crucial assets in building a democratic Syria. However, without outside support, already fragile state institutions, are in danger of collapse as communities face the dangers of disintegration. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>the ICT developments specially aimed to raise the economic and social levels of the population takes place in Sri Lankan at a pace much lower than what it is in the developed world. This can be due to several complex reasons. One reason can obviously be the high cost of ICT, but it will be difficult to think making ICTs financially viable - provided it is a feasible solution - only will be a panacea for all woes. Put into a practical example, just introducing Internet kiosks at villages level will not help to make rural communities to get the best out of Internet. The more important questions will be what sort of benefits the rural population can gain from Internet and how convenient and economical Internet can be in that, compared to the traditional means they are used to. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This brief includes the latest HIV surveillance data from India, focusing on key populations and bridge populations, including single migrant males and long-distance truck drivers, throughout the country. Findings from HSS 2010-11 corroborate the fact that National AIDS Control Programme is on the track to contain the epidemic. However, at the same time, the data also highlights the emerging epidemics, albeit at low level, in low prevalence states, which warrants increased focus on bridge populations’ role in the epidemic dynamics, particularly in north India. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This chapter explores issues and challenges related to the collection of data about the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education in East Asia. Despite widespread efforts across the region to introduce ICTs in education systems, little comparable data exist to help guide policy makers as they make important investment decisions. This knowledge gap complicates efforts of many Asian countries to benchmark their progress and to ensure that their ICT investments for schools are strategic, are cost-effective, and have an impact. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Ship-recycling in Bangladesh has been playing as a catalyst for the economy by supporting steel industry, shipbuilding industry and other industries and it has also been generating huge employments for the country. But, existing problems of this industry in terms of safety, health and environmental issues bring negative image for the country sometimes. This paper is aimed to identify the underlying problems of ship recycling industry and then analyze the nature of the problems to make it helpful overcoming the obstacles. A brief overview about strength, weakness, opportunity and threat of the industries in global perspective has been also discussed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Citizens across the world are constantly innovating new mechanisms of holding their governments accountable for their actions. One such mechanism that is gaining popularity in developing countries is E-governance. Using two case studies of
Online Public Grievance Redressal Mechanism (OPGRM), namely Online Complaint Management System (OCMS) in the
city of Mumbai and eGovernments Foundation’s Public Grievance Redressal mechanism (eGov-PGR) operational in the
city of Bangalore, this paper seeks answer to the questions – can accountability be mainstreamed in e-governance initiatives? Can citizens use e-governance initiatives to hold government officials accountable? An extensive review of literature including evaluation reports, official documents, WebPages, and news reports were undertaken in order to situate each of these cases in relation to the theoretical framework. Interview with government officials using this system were also interviewed. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>HIV pandemic is one of the most serious health crisis the world face today . Approximately 5-10% of all cases of HIV are children. Nearly all those children acquired infection through mother to child transmission either during pregnancy, delivery or by breastfeeding. So to protect the children from HIV perinatal transmission should be prevented. Whenever possible maternal HIV infection should be identified before or during pregnancy. This allows for earlier initiation of care for the mother and for more effective intervention to prevent perinatal transmission. A equitable and accessible maternal health system incorporating an effective AIDS screening program with adequate information provision, counseling and confidentiality is a prerequisite to this. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>BRAC’s innovative initiative ‘Social and Financial Empowerment of Adolescents’ (SoFEA) launched in 2009 works to empower adolescent girls both socially and financially through creating “social network” among its members. Apart from providing social interaction opportunities, the clubs also provide the members with
social and legal awareness lessons, as well as trainings on life-skills, livelihoods and financial literacy. This qualitative exploration attempts to gauge two important issues:to what extent the social networks of the girls are transformed due to the intervention, and effect of the financial literacy training on participant girls’ lives,
especially in the forms of knowledge retention, implementation and planning for the future. It also aims to identify the extent to which these girls have formed networks within the community, and finally analyses the members’ institutional network and involvement with income generating activities through using the financial literacy

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) argues for increased focus on the conflict-disaster nexus in fragile and conflict-affected states. It is based on a study assessing the evidence base on the ways in which natural disasters affect conflict, how conflict affects natural disasters and how people are affected by multiple risks. The authors consider what can be learned from current practices to improve conflict prevention, statebuilding and disaster risk management to build resilience. They find that the complex conditions of intersecting vulnerability and risk require grounding an understanding of them in specific contexts. In most cases, natural disasters are found to exacerbate pre-existing conflicts. The paper reveals that conflict and fragility increase natural disasters impacts, particularly by increasing vulnerability to natural hazards. There appears to be a close association between the risk of mortality from drought, state fragility and climate change vulnerability; however, the intersection between mortality risk from other natural hazards (such as cyclones and earthquakes) and state fragility appears to be much less pronounced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations for international policy, programming and finance include the following. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Managing risk in fragile and conflict-affected states should be a key feature of the post-2015 disaster risk reduction (DRR) agreement (Hyogo Framework 2).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The World Bank 2014 World Development Report should set a new agenda for managing risks in fragile and conflict-affected states. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Political Champions for Disaster Resilience Group should promote inter-agency coordination to build resilience in fragile and conflict-affected states, developing regional and national approaches to ex-ante risk management in such settings. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) should scale up programming in fragile and conflict-affected states and create closer links with the conflict prevention work of the World Bank. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The paper further recommends that bilateral donors and United Nations agencies create joint risk taskforces in key fragile and conflict-affected states and explore new ways of working and building the evidence base about how to better invest in ex-ante risk management measures. Developing new conceptual frameworks and analytical tools is also advised, as well as modifying existing ones (such as statebuilding, peacebuilding and conflict sensitivity frameworks) to reflect disaster risk and vice versa. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Financial support for mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries is at the core of the climate negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is due to the legal obligations created by the Convention itself and the critical role of finance in enabling developing countries to take ambitious climate action. This policy brief highlights that the Green Climate Fund (GCF) should anticipate and prepare to act upon issues that are likely to emerge in the fifth review of the UNFCCC’s financial mechanism, with a view to securing favourable results. These issues include: building on the best features of the existing funds and learning from their shortcomings; clarifying roles and responsibilities between the GCF and the UNFCCC’s Conference of the Parties (CoP) to avoid varying interpretations; and anticipating the possibility that the SCF will initiate an independent review of the GCF. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The maturing of the manufacturing sector in many Asian countries, combined with the relative backwardness of its service sector, has made service sector development a top priority for developing Asia. This paper surveys and analyses the current landscape of the region&amp;rsquo;s service sector so as to assess its potential to serve as an engine for inclusive economic growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper figures that services already account for a large share of the region&amp;rsquo;s output and employment. However, its productivity greatly lags that of the advanced economies, which implies ample room for further growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;there is plenty of scope of further enhancement and development for Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sector&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Asia&amp;rsquo;s future growth will depend increasingly on raising productivity in the service sector &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;one key challenge for all Asian countries is to improve the quality of service sector data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;creating more competitive services markets by removing a wide range of internal and external policy distortions is vital for improving service sector productivity &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;internally, this include the strengthening of labour and capital markets, reform of tax regimes, and elimination of burdensome regulations &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;externally, this involves reducing barriers to trade in services, which can promote efficiency and contribute directly to exports and growth&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;equally important, complementary investments in physical infrastructure and human capital will also be necessary to achieve a strong service sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The authors finally make a point that creating a more competitive environment for service industries must be the overall guiding principle for Asian policymakers. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study analyses climate change factors (temperature and rainfall) and their projected future values in the Delta state, Nigeria. A variety of crops such as maize, yam and cassava produced in Delta state depend on rainfall for their optimum performance. Therefore, decreasing and/or irregular rainfall patterns threaten food security in the state. This study reveals increasing trends of temperature values and decreasing rainfall values in the state. However, projected future rainfall values indicated an increasing trend. The study suggests that the increasing trends in temperature values may lead to a situation were crops will be smothered by excessive heat, thereby reducing food production in the state. The study recommends that meteorological station units should be established in the rural farming households in the state where accessibility is difficult. This will improve the availability of meteorological data for the benefit of poor rural farming households. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This discussion paper from the United Nations Development Programme examines the experiences of Asia-Pacific countries in establishing and managing extra-budgetary national climate funds (NCFs). The purpose is to provide an overview of the key issues decision-makers face in designing, implementing and managing climate funds in the region; and to offer practical examples of countries' experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper begins by contextualising NCFs within the overall national climate finance environment and by explaining the methodology of the research (including literature review, e-discussions, case study analysis and a regional clinic). The report itself covers three main phases of establishing NCFs:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Decision-making &amp;ndash; This includes information on defining strategic goals, evaluating options and capacity, identifying beneficiaries and sources of funds, and time/cost considerations. A range of questions, recommendations and notes of caution for decision-makers are presented in order to aid with the development of a feasibility analysis prior to establishing an NCF.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Designing NCFs &amp;ndash; The report explains the intricacies of the various fund types available, and their legal and governance requirements. Design features should be selected according to pre-defined strategic goals and take into account the political commitment and resources available, as well as the target time for when the fund should be operational. An option that should be considered as an immediate and temporary solution is external (of government) sinking funds. As the simplest fund type, they do not require parliamentary approval and can be administered by multilateral agencies. If the aim of the fund is to provide sustainable income from investments whilst channelling it to intended beneficiaries, then an endowment fund is the suggested choice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Managing NCFs &amp;ndash; The paper outlines aspects of the fiduciary standards required and explains the importance of performance based monitoring (both technical and financial), working alongside beneficiaries at the local level, and adapting or initiating new programmes should monitoring indicate a drift from intended goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The report concludes with a note on the importance of integrating a strong capacity development strategy into NCF design. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study argues that the underdeveloped service sector in Asia has the potential to become a new engine of economic growth for developing Asia, though the region has traditionally relied on export-oriented manufacturing to power its growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper reveals that its analysis provides substantial cause for optimism about the role of the service sector as an engine of growth in Asia. In this sense, it highlights that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the analysis of 12 Asian economies indicates that the service sector already contributes substantially to the region&amp;rsquo;s growth &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;furthermore, in the past, the service sector made the biggest contribution to national GDP growths comparing with other sectors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a number of Asian countries have been able to achieve substantial labour productivity gains in the service sector &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in addition, the share of service sector output that is exported tends to rise over time in most Asian countries, and that is higher than developed countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The authors conclude that services are set to play an even bigger role in the future, underlying particularly that the lower the per capita GDP, the greater the scope for labour productivity growth in the service sector. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the document stresses that a wide range of internal impediments&amp;mdash;e.g., excessive regulation and state monopolies&amp;mdash;and external impediments&amp;mdash;e.g., barriers to services trade and FDI&amp;mdash;shackle Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sector. The paper argues that removing those obstacles will unleash the full potential of Asia&amp;rsquo;s service sector to generate jobs and growth. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This book about the hype surrounding new ICT technology and its relation to
governmental change has shown that societal problems (e.g. communication between
governments and citizens) cannot be solved by technology. A strong and deterministic belief in a ‘technological fix’ has been proven wrong. New technologies can help solve technical problems, and of course, technology that is currently being applied can be an enabler for the improvement of social practices. However, the idea that the Internet can solve complex social questions in the governance of the educational system, healthcare, infrastructures and water works, to mention but a few along with the assumption that technologies can be used unproblematically to solve governmental problems (such as the gap between citizens and government), make government more transparent and link organizational functions is rather naive. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Community level healthcare activities are important in low income countries like Bangladesh where the coverage of formal healthcare systems is low. Keeping pace with the national strategies and MDG targets, BRAC, has initiated a programme for
improving maternal, neonatal, and child survival (IMNCS) in the rural areas of Bangladesh. The objective of the study is to provide information on economic costs of providing maternal, neonatal and child health services in this intervention. The study was conducted in two IMNCS intervention districts (Nilphamari and Gaibandha)
and one control district (Netrokona) where there is BRAC Essential Health Care (EHC) intervention. All resources mobilized by the programme for service delivery were identified, quantified and valued combining top-down and bottom-up approach. Market value approach was applied to capture the opportunity cost of free resources and volunteer time. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper is a &amp;quot;call to arms&amp;quot; to the research community to help move the network forward on a path to greater openness. Authors envision a world in which users can move freely between any wireless infrastructure, while providing payment to in-frastructure owners, encouraging continued investment. They think the best path to get there is to separate the network service from the underlying physical infrastructure, and al-low rapid innovation of network services, contributed by re-searchers, network operators, equipment vendors and third party developers. They propose to build and deploy an open but backward compatible wireless network infrastructure that can be easily deployed on college campuses worldwide. Through virtualisation, we allow researchers to experiment with new network services directly in their production network. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper begins with a discussion of the three policy approaches that can be adopted to harness information and communication technologies (ICTs) in developing countries, and the implications of each vis-à-vis development and gender issues. Presenting the specific social and development contexts in the South Asian countries, the paper highlights the current state of ICTs in these countries as well as national efforts to promote ICT through policy directives. These are then examined in light of the three ICT approaches to understand their potential towards achieving gender equality and social development. Case studies from the region are used to analyse the four pillars of the general framework - women's identity, control over technology, collective action and institutional change - and to develop recommendations for ICT policies in South Asia such that they hold positive and transformative potential for women. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) is a global partnership of governments, businesses, civil society and indigenous peoples groups focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest carbon stock conservation, the sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (i.e. REDD+ activities). Thirty-six forest developing countries have so far been selected to join the FCPF. This annual report for 2012 highlights progress during the facility's fourth year of implementation with regard to REDD+ readiness, funding for REDD+ and partnership building. The report also includes the financial report of the facility and the outlook for 2013. It concludes that the next few years will show whether overall momentum can be sustained to address the more challenging aspects of REDD+ and eventually determine whether REDD+ can accomplish its objectives on the ground. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An estimated 25 percent (36 million) of Bangladesh's population live in urban areas. The largest urban concentration is in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA), which has a total population estimated at about 12 million. Of this, about 8.6 million live in the core city (administered by the Dhaka City Corporation, DCC). About 4 million of the population of the DMA lives in urban slums (World Bank 2008). The Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) is estimated to be one of the fastest growing mega city in the world. Piped water supply systems are available in the four largest cities of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi, as well as in 102 of the 309 pourashabas (urban municipalities) (ibid.), although coverage of piped water supply systems is partial, uneven and inefficient in many cases. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication technology (ICT) has become, within a very short time, one of the basic building blocks of modern society. Many countries now understanding the importance of ICT and mastering the basic skills and concepts of it as part of the core of education. Organizations, experts and practitioners in the education sector increasingly recognizing the importance of ICT in supporting educational improvement and reform. This paper addresses the convergence of ICT and education. When two technologies are converging to each other, together they will generate some great opportunities and challenges. This paper focuses on these issues. In introduction section, it explains the ICT, education, and ICT-enhanced education. In next section it describes need of ICT in education, relationship between ICT skills and education, and stages of teaching learning process. The next two sections describe opportunities and challenges in integrating ICT in education. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study examines the adaptive capacities of farmers to climate change adaptation strategies and their effects on rice production in the northern region of Ghana. The adaptive capacities of rice farmers were estimated quantitatively and categorised into high, moderate and low adaptive capacities. Double logarithmic regression model of Cobb-Douglas production function was used to quantify the effects of adaptive capacities of farmers on rice production. On the average, the study finds that farmers are moderately adaptive to climate change. Moreover, rice farmers with high adaptive capacities obtained nine more 50 kilogram bags of paddy rice than farmers with low adaptive capacities. Therefore, a farmer’s adaptive capacity directly correlates to the number of bags of rice he or she obtains. The study recommends that rice farmers in Ghana should be empowered through better extension services in order to attain a higher adaptive capacity status, thus helping them to obtain more rice. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>HIV/AIDS epidemic is still a major societal problem in developing countries, especially in Africa. ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) is seen as one of the most important solutions in order to provide HIV/AIDS preventive education for all members of the society. In this study, authors performed a literature review in order to identify the uses of ICT for HIV/AIDS preventive education in developing countries with a specific focus on teenagers. Authors also searched information about the existing methodologies for the design and development of technology supported HIV/AIDS preventive education. Authors reviewed altogether 20 articles reporting uses of ICT for HIV/AIDS preventive education. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The relationship between government and household consumption is one of the contentious issues in both theory and empirics although this has significant implications in fiscal policy. The empirical studies on the relationship between government and household consumption provide contrasting results. The present study examines public-private consumption relationship in the Bangladesh economy using the cointegration and error 
correction modeling approaches to tackle the problem of non-stationary data. Two different variants of cointegration technique have been employed and in both cases a valid long run positive relationship is found. However, the error correction model finds an inverse relationship between the two in the short run. In general, the findings go with the Barro-Ricardian equivalence hypothesis of government spending that household consumption is unrelated 
to government consumption decision in the long-run. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The digital revolution throughout the world has brought about new challenges as well as new opportunities for the information professionals. The information professionals of the developing countries are grappling with problems like weak infrastructure, lack of skilled manpower, financial stringency etc. in implementing information and communication technologies in the libraries and also in the digitization of information resources. This paper explores the problems and potential of ICT and digitization in context of the library and information sector of Bangladesh. An elaborate analysis of various challenges for establishing digital information systems and services in the backdrop of the socio-economic realities of Bangladesh has been presented in the paper, along with indications as to how these challenges could be overcome. The paper ends with the conviction that, if these challenges could be dealt with successfully, the Vision 2021 stated by the Government could be realized in time. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>An ICT policy that produces broad access quickly is better than one that does not. Accordingly, success in ICT policymaking can be measured by three empirical measures: speed of passage, scope of implementation, and distribution, as well as one normative measure, process. "Process" represents an important normative dimension of ICT policymaking. Process measures the extent to which the ICT policymaking involves the citizenry, as represented by individuals, civil society groups, local private sector groups, and ideally, urban and rural residents ("wananchi"). Kenya is a case of slow speed of passage, low scope of implementation, low distribution, but high process. The political history of Kenya‘s ICT policymaking explains why this county, with such capable people and relatively open ICT policymaking, has struggled to keep up with its poorer neighbors. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>China’s entry into the WTO, and consequently, into global apparel markets under the newly emerging WTO-ATC regime, was thought to have several implications for apparels trade. Some of these were: (a) China’s entry would put downward pressure on global apparels prices as a result of which prices were likely to go down, undermining the competitive strength of other countries; (b) a surge in imports from China would drive out developed country apparels producers; and (c) the architecture of global apparels market would undergo drastic changes with China becoming the dominant player by a long shot. 
The rise of China has major repercussions for a country such as Bangladesh which has emerged as an important player in the global apparels market. Impact and implications of competition from China will have to be examined and scrutinized at country level and for disaggregated items of apparels (since the impact for particular countries will be felt only at the disaggregated product level). &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This report finds that the urban poor are highly vulnerable to climate change in Colombia. However, the country has not yet included adaptation to climate change within its national policies. The report first describes climate change trends and scenarios in Latin America and Colombia, and presents findings from Boyac&amp;aacute; and Cundinamarca highlighting likely ecosystem and livelihood transformations for urban settlements. It then discusses national, regional and urban policies and institutions for adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR), and presents a framework for understanding interactions among institutional and social actors. The report also includes case studies and it reviews historical trends in infrastructure and public services. The conclusion finds that Colombia faces many challenges in urban adaptation, including designing and implementing adaptation policies across institutions, sectors and scales and achieving democratic, effective and inclusive urban governance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>It is often assumed that transboundary water systems are potential sources of conflict that can exacerbate political, social, and economic tensions and cause disputes concerning the distribution, use and management of water. While some scholars conclude that water wars are inevitable, others claim that engagement over water issues can serve to build peaceful cooperation, as its necessity is taken as common ground between states. Water stress can thus be seen not only as a potential source of conflict, but as an opportunity for cooperation. This report presents the results of a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort by a team of researchers from Norway and South Asia, approaching the issue of water scarcity in Bangladesh with a view not only to conduct research on river water availability, but also to help promote awareness and knowledge-sharing on river water management in the region. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The 2013 Human Development Report (HDR) focuses on rising powers in international development and their human development implications. According to HDR, the developmental paths of Brazil, China and India, as well as less well recognised success stories such as Bangladesh, Mauritius and Turkey, are reshaping ideas about how to attain human development. The report recommends four focus areas for sustaining momentum on development: enhancing equity; expanding citizen participation, including better representation of the South in global governance systems and of youth; and increasing efforts to address environmental and demographic challenges. The HDR also calls for new institutions to facilitate South-South cooperation and regional integration, and greater transparency and accountability. HDR reports significant progress on health, wealth and education, but highlights that inaction on climate change could end gains in the world's poorest countries and communities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The coast of Bangladesh (14.2 million ha, of which roughly coastal brackish waters cover 17%) is the most hazardous coast in the world in terms of the number of people who suffer from various types of environmental hazards every year. Present study was conducted in the Sitakunda Upazilla as this Upazilla is one of the coastal areas of Bangladesh and affected by multiple vulnerabilities of natural disaster. The present study aims to understand involvement of women and men in disaster economic loss uplift in the defined study area. Data were collected by questionnaire interview of communities and then statistically analyzed by using computer based software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) to test the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between men and women in disaster economic loss uplift. Both men and women participate in economic activities to uplift their economic loss. T-test result shows that without fish catching (tc0i=1.98, tiob=1.68) there is no signi &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This brief offers solutions for Improving health care in rural areas: Information and communications technology solutions
for least developed countries. This brief summarizes cost-effective information and communication technology (ICT) applications to support improvements in these four areas in least developed, landlocked and small island countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and recommends policy options to better benefit from such applications. The Asia-Pacific region is underserved by health-care workers (20 per 10,000 persons in 2007). This is a consequence of factors such as emigration, low levels of investment in human resources and poor working conditions. To address this problem, ICT can be applied. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades, countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru have developed new mechanisms to foster citizen participation at the local level by creating citizen participation bodies, or 'local councils'. These are institutional spaces where citizens come together with municipal authorities to discuss and make decisions about local development and governance issues. In particular, they allow greater participation of groups that were
historically left out of decision making processes, such as women, youth and indigenous populations. This Brief analyses the experience of local councils in Latin America, highlighting key outcomes, design features and contextual factors that enabled their implementation. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>&lt;p&gt;This snapshot provides information on the current situation for HIV and LGBT rights and advocacy in Malaysia.&amp;nbsp;The composition of Malaysia&amp;rsquo;s HIV epidemic is changing rapidly. Whereas it was previously understood to be more heavily concentrated among people who use drugs (PWUD), sexual transmission appears to be on the rise. Women and MSM in particular are facing an increasing share of new infections. Given the emphasis that PWUD have received in research and prevention programmes in Malaysia over the last several years, some postulate that decreased transmission among PWUD enhances the vividness of risk among other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam inevitably influences how homosexuality is viewed by the general public and may influence sexual risk taking behaviours in ways that are not entirely understood. Ostracisation from family and friends, class discrimination, and social stigmatisation are all common experiences for MSM in Islamic countries. Risk might also rise from the belief that adherence to religious teachings should suffice as protection from HIV; or in some cases, a view of HIV transmission as an inescapable fate. These hypotheses were confirmed by recent focus groups and are in line with data that indicate higher HIV risk among Malays as compared to their Chinese peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with key findings drawn from a series of epidemiological and behavioural studies released in the last few years, there is a compelling case for increased programmatic attention to MSM. Malaysia found that civil society groups such as the Pink Triangle (PT) Foundation are well positioned to scale up prevention programmes in key areas but suffer from scarce funding, legal conflicts, and general stigma. Malaysia simultaneously faces a situation where MSM within reach of venue-based outreach efforts are disproportionately educated and well off. Further work will need to be done to develop a more accurate understanding of HIV risk among Malays and lower socioeconomic classes. In the interim, Malaysia faces an opportunity to inspire the political will that could play a pivotal role in the future of the epidemic. Cooperation between government and a burgeoning LGBT civil society may indeed be the most promising path forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snapshot provides more information about priorities for Malaysia reaching the three zeros, the most recent epidemiological data, behavioural information and programmatic information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Agriculture employs about a third of the population in the Peruvian regions of Jun&amp;iacute;n and Piura. Yet agricultural productivity is impeded by low technology and investments, as well as fragmented land tenure. Climate events already have massive impacts on the agricultural sector and climate change is likely to further intensify these effects. This report argues that climate risk management strategies in agriculture must address current climate variability while preparing the sector for the eventual impacts of warming and glacier retreat. These include more efficient water management and irrigation; improved access to markets and finance; livelihood diversification; revival of ancestral agricultural practices, for example in frost protection; climate-proofing local infrastructure; and better management of climate and risk data. To enable these measures, key climate risk management policies and agencies must be better coordinated in Peru. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>At present a new era has evolved in the education sector by means of ICTS. Different ICTs are now set to become instrumental to help expand access to education, strengthen the relevance of education to the increasingly digital workplace, and raise educational quality by, among others, helping make teaching and
learning into an engaging, active process connected to real life. The application and exposure to and deployment of ICTs fundamentally change the way education is conceived and delivered to students. ICTs are enablers that optimize student-centered pedagogical methods. Due to its easy accessibility this means of education has become very popular all over the world. This paper intends to give an idea about ICT-based higher education all over the globe and its applicability in Bangladesh. Finally, it analyses the responses from different user groups to query about the current status of the ICT-based higher education system Bangladesh. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

It is clearly evident from the result that capture fishery and fishermen's share are decreasing with the increasing of intermediaries share in the marketing channels day by day. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper suggests a framework for integrating climate change into the design of public spaces in developing countries. The aim is to explain the urgent need for public-space design codes in developing countries that factor in global warming and climate extremes. The paper argues that environmental considerations must form an integral part of such design to ensure human wellbeing. It suggests a regionally-sensitive conceptual model capable of managing the growing challenges, including rapid urbanisation, growing slums and ineffective planning policies. Present policy and urban development is often limited by rigid frameworks, which are unsuitable to managing such an informal and dynamic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The report suggests a generic conceptual framework for developing regional design codes for public spaces called the &amp;lsquo;Regional Codes for Outdoor Spaces Model&amp;rsquo;. Taking account of residents' daily lives, it incorporates community participation in both the development of the codes, as well as the maintenance of the space itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model includes three key steps:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Analytic &amp;ndash; This step involves investigating the relationship between the physical and cultural, both on a psychological level (place-related identity, attitude to public space, etc.) and a practical one (traditional clothing, comfort, etc.). This is important since cultural factors can directly affect one's perception of thermal comfort, meaning that perception cannot be neatly correlated with temperature metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Evaluative &amp;ndash; Consisting of interviews and observation, this crucial step should carefully consider both the length of stay and space typologies, dividing analytic results accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Regulative &amp;ndash; This includes the development of design guidelines focused on shading, vegetation, wind and ventilation, water use, and materials. All of these factors impact thermal comfort, though it is important that implementation is context-sensitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The authors note a paucity of studies on micro-climate and thermal comfort in developing countries, especially with regard to the impacts on social dynamics. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Norway's Oil for Development (OfD), begun in 2005, is a comprehensive program addressing resource, financial and environmental dimensions with a focus on capacity development in the public sector but including larger sector governance concerns. The petroleum sector is increasing in importance world-wide: the number of producer countries is growing, including in poor states with weak governance systems, and prices remain high. The threat of the “oil curse” where private companies and corrupt elites capture most of the benefits for themselves is posing global governance challenges, including to democracy and gender gains. OfD should have the “oil curse” as its main concern, and build strategic alliances and its own program around this. Sector governance issues should have a societal and not just public sector focus. Country programs should maintain the three “pillars” of resource, revenue and environment but be more inclusive of aspects such as safety. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a tool for analysing potential health issues during planning stages of proposals using established systematic mechanisms to demonstrate factors that could affect health and to consider potential response options. This study used the HIA framework to consider potential health impacts of climate change on the population of Vanuatu, to assess the risks and propose adaptive responses. The HIA process involved the participation of a broad range of stakeholders including expert sector representatives in the areas of biophysics, socioeconomics, infrastructure, environmental diseases and food. The risk associated with each of the impacts was assessed with the application of a qualitative process that considered both the consequences and the likelihood of each of the potential health impacts occurring. Adaptation strategies and actions were developed to mitigate the identified health impacts and provide response options for the various sectors in Vanuatu. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Adaptation to climate change in tropical highland regions is complicated, because elevation contrasts and dissected topography produce diverse climatic conditions that are often accompanied by significant ecological and agricultural diversity within a relatively small region. Such is the case for the Choke mountain watersheds, in the Blue Nile highlands of Ethiopia. The physical diversity of the area and the accompanying socio-economic contrasts demand diverse strategies for enhanced climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. To support these goals, this study presents an agroecosystem analysis of Choke Mountain, under the premise that the agroecosystem (the intersection of climatic and physiographic conditions with agricultural practices) is the most appropriate unit for defining adaptation strategies in these primarily subsistence agriculture communities. The paper provides two approaches to agroecosystem analysis that can be applied to climate resilience studies. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This study aims at determining the magnitude of the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risk factors in Malawi. Methodology used includes the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance which was conducted in 2009. : A total of 5,206 adults (67% females) were surveyed. Tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and raised blood pressure (BP) were more frequent in males than females, 25% vs 3%, 30% vs 4% and 37% vs 29%. Overweight, physical inactivity and raised cholesterol were more common in females than males, 28% vs 16%, 13% vs 6% and 11% vs 6%. Tobacco smoking was more common in rural than urban areas 11% vs 7%, and overweight and physical inactivity more common in urban than rural areas 39% vs 22% and 24% vs 9%, all with p,0.05. Overall (both sexes) prevalence of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and physical inactivity was 14%, 17%, 22%, 10% and prevalence of raised BP, fasting blood sugar and cholesterol was 33%, 6% and 9% respectively. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>In reconstructing post-conflict states, more attention needs to be paid to the social contracts. Following the philosopher Montesquieu, this paper argues that liberty, in the form of checks on executive power, must accompany or precede multi-party democracy in post-conflict reconstruction.The paper elaborates the experiments of post-conflict African countries and illustrates that: • the absolutism of imperial presidents is at the root Africa's civil wars and the restoration of this institution in post-conflict states will not help them find security for their citizens • elections are central to legitimating new governments, but when elections are conducted without the support of other democratic institutions they can provoke violent conflict rather than offering an alternative to it • among the institutions that can support democracy are those that deliver liberty, a genuinely independent judiciary and other countervailing powers to the presidency • indeed, without appropriate institutional checks, multi-party democracy can rekindle violent conflicts rather than help to resolve them • yet, the institutions of liberty are more likely to succeed if they are given constitutional authority and donor support. The author concludes that it is more feasible to see the challenge of post-conflict reconstruction as one of creating real checks on imperial presidents than one of creating free and fair electoral contests between competing political parties. In this respect, the author believes that the international community should reconsider its spending on the improvement of post-conflict elections in favour of the creation and consolidation of the institutions of liberty. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>For more than three decades microfinance has been one of the key
development interventions in Bangladesh. This model of innovative
financial services such as credit and savings in conjunction with nonfinancial components like capacity building have been playing
instrumental roles in income smoothing and consumption smoothing of the low-income people. However, health shocks are unpredictable and eventually can trap poor and near poor households indefinitely into vicious poverty cycles. Therefore, a safety-net component against health shocks for the low-income groups and protecting the clients from catastrophic health expenditure should be an integral part of a development intervention like microfinance. This study is aimed to introduce the concept
of ‘Micro Health Insurance’ as a tool for addressing the vulnerability
context of low income households. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Malnutrition has long been recognized as a consequence of poverty and lack of basic nutrition education. The close relationship between malnutrition and under-development has continued to be emphasized. Adequate nutrition is a sine qua non for cognitive and economic development and a key indicator of progress in human development. Therefore, reducing malnutrition is an important goal of development. The Federal Government of Nigeria has formulated this National Policy to deal with the multifaceted problem of nutrition, using a multisectoral and multidisciplinary program approach. The program to be derived from this policy is expected to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition by alleviating poverty through increased access to productive resources, increased incomes and enhanced standards of living. This document is intended to serve a s framework to guide the identification and development of intervention programs and to address malnutrition problems across various sectors &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper tries to bring out the role of Indian state as an actor in responding to the ICT policy with special reference to the two task force reports highlighted in for carrying out this study. Response is here understood as the ‘role’ played by the Indian state towards putting policy statements into practice. The underlying intent of the theories is the belief that information would be the prime mover in information or knowledge societies. It is strongly believed that ICT will propel India into the league of developed nations. The literature review particularly on technological determinism and social shaping of technology gives us important perspective to explore the objectives of the study. At the same time they raise some important issues and questions: What are the broad objectives of major policies on ICT for development? To what extent policies formulated at the highest decision-making bodies find their way for implementation? Is there a gap between ‘Theory’ and ‘Practice’? &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Despite its declining prevalence, malaria infection remains as the main cause of disease and mortality in Kenya. It is also currently re-emerging in the western highlands due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic factors. The region’s population is highly vulnerable to malaria epidemics and the projected rise in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns may exacerbate existing health risks and create new ones. This report argues that in addition to strengthening the health system and improving collaboration among actors engaged in malaria control and climate risks, two actions should be prioritised for malaria control in the face of climate variability and change: 1) improving the monitoring and prediction of malaria epidemics in all regions by taking into account climate, health and socioeconomic data, as well as by combining local and scientific knowledge; 2) promoting a switch from top-down to more bottom-up targeted interventions adapted to local needs and specificities. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the health sector faces many challenges due to inadequate infrastructure and limited resources. This study has developed a Decision Support System (DSS) which incorporates Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to collect information from health workers through their mobiles, software modules to update data from IVRS to Database server automatically and system web site which generates dynamic on line reports from Database server for the perusal of health authorities. The DSS system is developed using Visual Basic 6.0, SQL Server 2000, ASP, Scripting Languages, Windows 2003 SBS and IIS. Services of Toll Free Landline Telephone Connection, 1mbps Broadband Internet Connection, Static IP, GSM Mobile SIM and SMS Package were taken from Telephone Service Provider. The developed DSS system is deployed at Desert Medicine Research Centre (ICMR), Jodhpur, India. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Countries in sub-saharan Africa are facing a double burden of communicable disease and non-communicable diseases. This paper argues that knowledge of their common determinants and the links between diseases should be used to spur development of coordinated programmes to prevent and treat both. The paper discusses the essence of the problem, the approach to take in proffering an intervention, and barriers that could impede interventions. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This position paper from the African women&amp;rsquo;s rights regional steering group on the post-2015 development framework builds on discussion that took place at the African women&amp;rsquo;s consultation in October 2012. It contains two sections; the first is on gender in the current MDGs, and the second looks at gender within a post-2015 framework. While recognising that the MDGs have been successful in drawing attention towards poverty as an urgent global priority, the authors argue that the simplification of the goals and a focus on quantification rather than quality has meant that the development agenda has been reduced to meeting basic material needs, and has not addressed equity, empowerment or building sustainable capacity for economic growth. The paper states that &amp;ldquo;gender targets continue to be a moving goal with inequalities persisting in many countries and contexts&amp;rdquo;. It goes on to list some examples of this, including the low progress made on MDG 5 to reduce maternal mortality. However, the authors also make ten recommendations for priority action by African states before the MDGs end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When considering the post-2015 development framework, the paper argues that any framework should seek to redress ideological assumptions within the current MDGs. For example, it should recognise that Africa has rich natural and human resources, which if managed well, could facilitate sustainable and equitable growth in the continent. It should also integrate human and women&amp;rsquo;s rights principles, rather than taking a sole focus on economic growth. Five groups of minimum outcomes are suggested as a way of ensuring that any new framework can recognise and address the gaps inherent in the MDGs. These groups are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Accessible universal primary education and strengthening of post primary education &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Women&amp;rsquo;s health and zero tolerance on violence against women &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Guarantee women and girls&amp;rsquo; property rights &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Accelerating women&amp;rsquo;s economic empowerment &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Governance, peace and security &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Environmental sustainability &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A set of outcomes is suggested for each group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the paper sets out a series of overarching concerns. These cover: the donor centric view that has previously shaped the MDGs; aid flows and internal resource mobilisation; regional integration agendas; quantity versus quality; and the aid effectiveness agenda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The African women&amp;rsquo;s rights regional steering group on the post-2015 development framework includes FEMNET, AAWORD, EASSI, WiLDAF-WA, SADC Gender Protocol Alliance, Akina Mama wa Afrika, International Planned Parenthood Federation, Oxfam and Urgent Action Fund Africa. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This paper develops the Connected Health model so that it can be applied in developing countries that can afford only a simple infrastructure. It argues that when health is regarded as part of a holistic program of development, the aggregation of demand will make the connectivity needed to transform health (and other services) more affordable. The Cisco® Connected Health program embodies a framework and methodology for the application of advanced healthcare info-structures1 that adapt closely to specific challenges and priorities in each country, while drawing on proven technologies and vast experience of applications worldwide. Connected Health allows greater collaboration among professionals, faster delivery of patient care, easier and less demanding administration, and development of patient-centric healthcare services that enrich the quality of life and economic strength of the nation it serves. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus), a rheumatic disease of unknown cause, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against antigens, leading to inflammatory damage of many target organs including the joints, kidneys, blood cells, and the central nervous system1. SLE in children and
adolescents (pSLE) may have a great variability in disease presentation and course2. Childhood lupus frequently presents with systemic and constitutional symptoms like fever, fatigue, malaise etc. On the other hand they have a higher rate and severity of organ involvement3. So, disease damage develops more
quickly than adults. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The aim of this report is to update, when possible, the information provided in the report published in January 2008. Statistical data still demonstrates low participation of women in key R&amp;D areas, especially in engineering and technology, areas which are extremely important in achieving a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy for Europe. The main focus of this report is to look at recent statistical evidence relating to the participation of women in ICT sector in the European Union. In some cases, when relevant, comparisons will be made with other parts of the developed and emerging economies. The examination of the statistical data is subdivided into four areas as follows: • Education and skills development; • Women in ICT employment; • Women and Inventions; • Women in decision making positions. The information provided in this report is based on valid statistical evidence collected by institutions such as OECD and EUROSTAT &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>E-government and related Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are commonly understood to provide a great opportunity to innovate the business of government by fostering efficiency and reforming public management. This paper argues that the main approaches and methodologies used for the development of egovernment applications, services and infrastructure overlook the potential to provide innovative mechanisms for the reshaping of government services, policy making and implementation. The aim of this paper is to highlight the potential reforms either needed for, or as a consequence of, the various innovations introduced to public management by e-government, to critically evaluate the dominant models underpinning the development of electronic services associated with such reforms, and ultimately to present an alternative approach – an alternative problematisation – one appropriate for the conceptualization of information infrastructures that serve the goals of governance. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The movement towards a green economy is seen as a critical pathway to achieving sustainable development. More importantly, it is an opportunity for investments in green industries, job creation and improvements in human welfare. In this synthesis report, five development sectors for small island developing states (SIDS) - small-scale fisheries and aquaculture, water, tourism, energy and solid waste - are analysed in an attempt to show how a transition to a green economy can assist in addressing some of the most critical challenges SIDS face while conserving resources. The paper highlights that these sectors are not only inter-related, but also reflect the SIDS’ challenges as they relate to land and water scarcity, dependence on imported energy, high costs associated with waste management and the vulnerability and fragility of the tourism sector. The report seeks to show how a transition to a green economy can contribute to advancing sustainable development in SIDS. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Norway's Oil for Development (OfD), begun in 2005, is a comprehensive program addressing resource, financial and environmental dimensions with a focus on capacity development in the public sector but including larger sector governance concerns. The petroleum sector is increasing in importance world-wide: the number of producer countries is growing, including in poor states with weak governance systems, and prices remain high. The threat of the â€œoil curseâ€ where private companies and corrupt elites capture most of the benefits for themselves is posing global governance challenges, including to democracy and gender gains. OfD should have the â€œoil curseâ€ as its main concern, and build strategic alliances and its own program around this. Sector governance issues should have a societal and not just public sector focus. Country programs should maintain the three â€œpillarsâ€ of resource, revenue and environment but be more inclusive of aspects such as safety. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Migration driven by environmental factors is emerging as a serious concern, one that demands urgent attention from decision makers. The current paper addresses this issue in the context of the Asian and Pacific countries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper highlights that Asia and Pacific region is expected to be one of the global regions most severely affected by climate change. However, climate change will not necessarily create a distinct category of migrant, but rather can be expected to interplay with other drivers of migration. Therefore, climate-induced migration should be addressed in the broader context of migration more generally, and as part of the development agenda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;with timely policies and investments, migration can be used as a tool of climate change adaptation, but appropriate policies and programs need to be formulated and put into operation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a key priority is to strengthen the resilience of communities to make migration an informed choice rather than an act of desperation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;governmental tools to boost community resilience include social protection, comprising labour market measures and social safety net programs, and the disaster risk management&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;urban planning should include incentives for people to settle in less vulnerable areas, and portable social benefits for incoming migrants&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;the particular vulnerabilities of women must be taken into consideration when designing policies and program &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;although most climate-induced migration will be internal, international cooperation will be essential to effectively address cross-border migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Policy recommendations made:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;invest in the knowledge base on the likely impacts of climate change on human mobility &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;lower information, financial, and regulatory barriers to emigration, and expand international labour migration opportunities through bilateral accords that provide worker protections&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;in cases where communities must relocate, draw on good international practice in resettlement, involving communities in the decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>This policy brief by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) estimates that the cost of tackling climate change in developing countries could reach some hundreds of billions of US dollars annually over the coming decades. Low-emission and climate-resilient development options often require upfront investments that can be costlier than conventional solutions. It points out that currently there is not a comprehensive global climate finance approach and it will time before the Green Climate Fund (GCF) will be operationalised. Developing countries require support in their efforts towards climate compatible development through the use of climate finance, both public and private, that enables equitable access, national ownership, and effective management and monitoring. This can be achieved by engaging in three priority areas: international climate finance architecture; recipient readiness; and enabling environment for private sector to invest in climate compatible development. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The usage of information and communication technology (ICT) is increasingly being seen as a major tool for development. In a huge country like India, this has deeper significances as the ICT enabled services can be used as an alternative to the
government services where the latter cannot reach directly to the citizens. However, taking ICT as a solution for various challenges in context to development has its own set of problematics. While India is increasingly appreciated globally for its
magnificent growth in the IT sector, a striking majority of people are grossly under privileged without even basic access to modern technologies. Researches show we are a nation fraught with worst kind of digital divide. In such a scenario, it is imperative to weigh the feasibility of using ICT as a tool for sustainable development. This paper looks into these problems, seeking to present a critique of the ongoing projects and suggests an alternative. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Information and communication Technologies is rapidly advancing and the old model a Teacher - Student has been outdated. This is the era of global learning communities. The main purpose of ICT enabled methods is to create a shared learning environment where knowledge and expertise are transferred as a group rather than from an individual expert. With the advent of open source softwares, the use of ICT have become more extensive and accessible to society. There is no doubt that ICT in education will definitely prepare children to think and communicate creatively and thus help them for successful lives and careers in an increasingly technological world. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>Multilevel, networked systems of governance are a fundamental fact of life in most African conflict settings. This article looks at the coordination networks that influence the management of aid-in-conflict in the case of Somalia. The paper clarifies that while coordination is a source of peer accountability, formal coordination in Somalia remains largely weak, non-binding and elusive. Consequently, the country is marked by general unease about accountability across all involved actors. The author underlines that humanitarian and development activities overlap over decades, notably in South Central Somalia. In addition, at the multi-sectoral level, divisions persist as to who leads coordination and through what means.
The document states that the internal division and perceived bias of key UN institutions, combined with their multiple roles make their task a difficult one. Nevertheless, the paper emphasises that effective solutions to problems can be found. Conclusions are as follows:
• the middle ground, the attempt to build capacity for public policy during engagement, would be a crucial part of any coherent strategy of engagement
• comprehensive aid strategies that comprise various logics of engagement need to be given shape by relatively autonomous donor country offices
• often, creative and successful coordination can occur based not on multi-sectoral agreements but programme-specific engagement that over time can be replicated in other areas
• differences in approaches will persist due to the heterogeneity of all actors and the multiplicity of interests involved
• trilateral dialogue about aid, including Somali counterparts, donors and the UN system should be tangible and at technical levels. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>The book’s title calls attention to this very special link between youth, innovation, social change, and technology. Once online tools began to be adapted and developed for the specific needs of ‘Generation 2.0,’ this sparked a shift in the purpose and value of ICT that is quite obviously associated with the change that young people have created as peers, mentors and leaders. The ‘digital shift’ has indeed been youth motivated and youth-powered, but not youth-centric. If anything, the increased social responsibility that young people have exhibited through ICT only shows just how closely connected the youth of today are—a natural response to a globalised world. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>

    <dcterms:abstract>There is no verse in the Quran which directly either permits the rule of women or prohibits it. The traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), mentioned in this article, against women as the head of the state are believed to be unreliable and unauthentic due to many reasons. As a result, we can say without contradiction that the Quran and Sunnah (Traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)) neither permit nor forbid the rule by women. Rather the silence of the Quran and the Hadith on this very important and vital issue is not without wisdom and sagacity. This deliberate silence means that Islam has given full freedom and direction to the Muslim community to decide on this matter according to the ever changing socio-political circumstances. &lt;img src='http://api.ids.ac.uk/tracking/trackimg.cfm?beacon_guid=14b4598a-0dc8-495d-9e89-194f3c03c10a' width='1' height='1'&gt;</dcterms:abstract>
