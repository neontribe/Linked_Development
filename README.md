Linked-Data
===========

Neontribe intend to develop two Turnkey patches for Linked Data.

1) A patch to install the infrastructure.  
2) A patch to install the open-data.  

A Turnkey patch compromisses the following structure:

patch-name/  
patch-name/debs/  
patch-name/overlay/  
patch-name/conf  

Once these two patches have been complete they can be applied to the "Turnkey Core" to produce installation media.
